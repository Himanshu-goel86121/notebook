      "Update on 02/22/2006.I have 3 of them. One was bought in May 2005. It stopped working on Feb. 10 2006. I called Netgear Customer Service and asked for a replacement. The thing has 3 year warranty. They just asked me to send the bad one back and would send a new one back to me. I received the new one on 02/21/2006. Thank you Netgear, and keep up the good job. One thing is important, don't forget to register your product. Someone had the same problem I had, Netgear refused to replace the bad one because he didn't register the product.It works right out of the box with zero configuration. It is fast too. My daughter's PC is DELL P3 with 256 MB Ram running Windows98 SE. She can watch a movie from cartoonnet.com without any problems. It has been tested on my home network with the PCs, CPU: amd Barton 2800+, intel P3/P4. OS: Windows 2000 with SP4, Windows 98 SE and windows XP Pro/Home with SP4. The adapter comes with a CD, that is for data encryptation between two PC that use Netgear adapters. It is nothing to do with configuration. You don't need do any configuration at all. Just plug it into a wall outlet, and then connect the cable between your pc and the adapter. Thast is it.At least you need two adapters, one is to hookup to your DSL/Router, the second one for the PC where ever you wand to hookup your PC.\n",
      "I bought two of these for less than I would have had to pay for one of the other alleged HD (well at least 720P) Webcams out there.  I even investigated refurbished models from Logitech and Microsoft that were more than double the price of one of these cameras.  I knew it was a gamble that these might not be what I was looking for or that, as with many products pouring out of China these days, the specs might be a complete lie.Imagine my surprise then when these turned out to be exactly what I need for the purpose I had in mind.I was looking for some USB webcams to use as barcode and QR code scanners for a few tablets and notebook computers I have.  And the problem I was having with the built-in cameras on this type of device (tablets and notebooks and even a laptop) was that their built-in cameras, front or back, couldn't focus closely enough to read most bar codes, although I was partly successful reading QR codes (the square codes you see often on magazine articles or advertisements) depending on how large they were printed - the larger the better since that meant I could hold them far enough away from the built-in cameras to still be in-focus.So the first test I conducted when I got these cameras was to try to scan barcodes and QR codes.  And lo and behold, as I played around with the cameras I discovered that they had a manual focus ring that you could set to focus as close as two inches or perhaps less - something I couldn't get the 2 logitech 1080p webcams and one Microsoft 1080p webcams to do.  So now I had what I really needed - the ability to scan close objects in focus and in a totally controllable way unlike the autofocus feature one of my webcams has which seems to spend more time trying to find focus than taking pictures.And the other great feature I like, besides the manual focus ring, is the illumination LEDs.  One thing I didn't notice when reading the product description, at least in part because the price was so low, was that these cameras came with manually adjustable illumination levels.  There's a small illumination level control, similar to the volume level control on some headphones, that allows you to control the LED brightness.  And that turns out to another plus for these cameras.  Sometimes you need no illumination and sometimes you need just a little and sometimes a lot depending on the surrounding lighting when you're trying to scan something.  That was an unexpected plus because sometimes when I was trying to scan an newspaper for a QR code or the UPC on colored labels on round surfaces I found that the built-in cameras on my tablets and notebooks were severely affected by the ambient light.  Since these cameras can be self-illuminating with their built-in LED lights that you can turn off and/or vary the amount of illumination, they make these cameras perfect for scanning anywhere at any time.  And with that feature they even make a decent flashlight when powered off a tablet's USB port!I haven't done a lot of testing for OCR recognition and even general photo-taking but from the quality I could see in the video image while using them as scanners they looked to have all the resolution they claim.And for my purpose, the mounting system for these cameras is perfect - they sit on a flat pedestal that allows the camera to rotate horizontally through 360 degrees and vertically through about 180 degrees.  And there's just enough friction in the pivot system both vertically and horizontally to allow the camera to be pointed in a specific direction and angel and remain there without change due to vibration or jolts.The round flat base also changes to a right angle base with a lipped edge suitable for placing on top of an LED monitor.  And if you are still using a CRT monitor then there's a pretty good chance you cam up with a configuration of the base that will work there.So I love these guys - I bought two and I may buy more - at the price they are an outstanding value proposition with no real equal at this pricepoint!\n",

      "I want a multi-purpose faster(with some zoom) lens for my Canon XS to replace KIT lens and do not want to spend a fortune.I want faster lens as I want to capture my little ones actions without using flash, and kit lens is no good for that. I know 50mm prime is great, but on APS-C it is equivalent to 80mm, and not usable indoor because of close quarters many times. I want atleast 35mm to start with.Though not veryfast, Lenses those match my requirement are Tamron 17-50 f2.8 and Sigma 18-50 f2.8 within my price range.Good, I got the lens from local retailer so that I can exchange if required, though I have to drive almost 50miles roundtrip to the store. It felt good in hand, much heavier than KIT lense, built is good.Hmm, pretty much all the photos are out of focus, some are okay. None of those are correctly in focus and I was comparing to Canon Kit lens with IS. Kit lens was much sharper.And another kicker, it was struggling to focus in low-light where KIT lens has absolutely no problem focussing in all Zoom ranges. Anyways since it is a bad copy, I drove again, spend almost 3 hour for getting a replacement.I was really hoping I would get a good copy. Oh, boy, again same BS. All photos soft. Then I started experiment with manual focus, and picture are tack sharp, and ofcourse as I expected the photos taken by Tamron are better than KIT lens, and I could use faster shutter speed. Manual focus ring is not good, I have rotate it very slowly/precisely to adjust focus.In further testing, I used liveview(QuickView Mode)focussed with auto-focus(I was using ZoomView on XS LCD), then slide it manual mode, then adjusted focus(slightly turn focus ring to clockwise)(Front focus issue). Now, it is tack sharp. For the kit lens, there is absolutely no issue.I took several photo where I have lot of fine text on Box in very good lighting with Auto and Manual mode, Auto Mode always Front Focussed.And to their credit it seem this second copy was not struggling to Focus that much in low-light(still not as good as KIT lens).But two copies later, 100 miles drive, 20+ hours of time spend over a week, I end up with nothing. Now, I need to drive back to return it, another 50 miles.In my opinion this ridiculous. Quality control at Tamron seems to be worst than one those cheap chainese toys. One would expect out of two brand new lenses atleast one would be good.As much as I want to love this lens, this is completely un-acceptable.I wonder how-many people really got a good copy the first time itself. It seems only 1 in 3 to 5, gets a good copy.Anyways, now I am tired, I just want to return it and forget about it. May be when I have too much time on my hand I may experiment with some other lenses.It is possible this is a specific batch issue, and if anyone cares, lens serial starts with 4000.But bottom line countless hours are wasted and a frustating experience.And Caution: I gave 1 star, but suddenly when I came back to edit something it took two stars!!!? whats up?NOTE: I used tripod to test focus issues in good lighting.Update: 01/06/2008: Anyways I went ahead and bought this lens from another local retailer. This copy did not have focus issues at all. But some how it has too much CA, and lens itself is producing much more softer images( more so than the one Front Focusing). It also has more red tinge to the images. I tried comparing with Kit lens at F3.5, F 5.6 with exactly same settings, and kit lens is always sharper. So 3 copies, first one Focus issues, 2nd front focussing, 3rd  very soft images. Guess what I gave up.\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "This is a great lens.  I got it three weeks ago and have taken a couple thousand pictures so far -- mostly at daytime youth soccer games but also at a couple of night games under lights and some random shots around the area.  The pictures it takes are tack sharp, the image stabilization is amazing, and the focusing is extremely quick.  Yes, it's heavy, very conspicuous and expensive, but the end result is the quality of the pictures, and I've been very happy.I had been using a Canon 70-300 USM lens since I bought a Canon 20D a few years ago, but after upgrading to the Canon 50D body last year, I started realizing that I was being limited by the quality of my old lens so I started shopping for a better lens to use when taking pictures at my son's soccer games.  I rented a couple of different \"L\" lenses from a local camera store to try them out:  the Canon 100-400mm L and the 28-300mm L.  Both lenses are very nice, and I tend to shoot more on the telephoto end of the scale,  and I liked the reach of the 400mm especially on the cropped sensor 50D, but the wider angle of the 28-300mm was a big positive as well.  The 28-300mm lens is a push-pull zoom -- you push or pull the barrel out or in rather like twisting it like so many zooms, and pull it back to go wide angle -- and the lens I rented seemed a bit hard to slide, so that turned me off.Finally after a year of thinking and looking at these, I bought it.  I'm getting used to the weight (I use a monopod most of the time anyway) and the push-pull zoom is so responsive that I'm really enjoying it too.  I find that I can quickly zoom in or out if the action suddenly moves towards or away from me, so I can get shots I never would have even tried before.  The lens also focuses very fast -- and very quietly.Comes front and rear caps, lens shade, and a nice zippered case.  I bought it used and it came with a with tripod ring, which I often use with my monopod.  Since the lens is so heavy, it's not recommended to use the camera's tripod mount because it puts too much strain on the connection between the camera and the lens.  The tripod ring is a ring that goes around the lens and has a screw to attach to the tripod at the center of gravity of the lens+camera combination.All lenses involve some type of trade offs.  With this lens you trade convenience (weight and bulk) and price for quick focus, quick zooming, sharp images, great stabilization which adds up to superb pictures.So, do like I did -- take a deep breath, shop around for price, and buy it.** Feb 2011 Update.  I have used it for 4 months now and like it even more.  I have seen I can take much sharper pictures than my old lens.** Oct 2011 Update.  Was appreciating the push-pull zoom action this past weekend while shooting a U19 club soccer game.  It's quick and intuitive and great for sports shots.\n",

      "This lens has been on my want list for a long time. I have the Canon 70-200 f/2.8 IS and it is great for versatility but it is not an easy lens to carry around all day due to the weight and the white color makes it stand out. The 70-200 produces good bokeh but the best is at 2.8 and 200mm and isn't always possible. I purchased the 135mm f/2 to save on weight, black coating and the bokeh at f/2. This lens has not disappointed me and the image quality is superb. The auto focus is fast and accurate when mounted on my 5D Mark III. The isolation of the subject from the background produces fantastic results that make pictures stand out. For most of my photography needs this a good lens to compliment my 35mm f/1.4. I can shoot most subjects and I know that both lenses will deliver great results. The weight savings of the primes compared to the 24-70 and 70-200 is huge and makes the day more enjoyable by not being burdened by the weight of equipment.This lens and focal length does take some getting used to and for some subjects is probably not the best choice. I have found that I do sometimes miss the versatility of the zoom when I am taking pictures of my son playing and he is constantly changing his distance from me and I can't always get the picture I want. If he is is playing and moving more parallel to me this isn't an issue but depending on your subject it is something to keep in mind. I wouldn't call this lens a replacement for the 70-200 but more of a compliment to it. I enjoy the results from both lenses and am satisfied with both. For me most of the time I will grab the 135mm just because I prefer the results that I get and it is much easier to take with me everywhere.Pros:- Ablility to shoot at f/2 and have sharp pictures without stopping down.- Much lighter lens than the 70-200 2.8- Awesome Bokeh that makes your subject stand out against every background.- Decent price for an L lens- Consistent results- Black coating doesn't stand out- Great lens to use with the 35mm 1.4Cons:- Lack of versatility- IS would be a nice but it would take away from some of the other things I like about this lens (weight and price).Conclusion:I would say that this lens is a specialty lens and may not be for everyone. The pictures that it takes are outstanding and very few lenses can come close in terms of price and quality. You do give up some versatility but this lens has delivered on all the aspects that are important to me and is my second most used lens behind my 35mm 1.4. I would not hesitate to recommend this lens to anyone but I would suggest that you look at any of Canon's excellent 70-200 lenses first if you do not have one.\n",

      "As every other reviewer has said this is one of the most interesting lens for a APS-C based camera like the Rebel Xti, 40D, and so on...So I was searching for a good walkaround lens. I seriously needed to ditch the kit lens that came with the Xti... The choices was to get one in around in 600$ range. After a much agonizing search (and learning) i came to realize that the lower end needed to be atleast 17mm (18mm with the kit lens is still not enough to get the whole statue of liberty from the bottom up, which the normal P&S; cameras would easily do) And around 40-50mm on the far end would be just fine. The contenders was either this Tamron or the Canon L series (17-40mm f/4 L). The Canon 16mm- version costs more than a grand so... I didn't mind losing a bit on the higher end BTW.So what made this my choice? Before getting this lens:First off, good photos are usually taken in a soft ambient light and getting a lower f-stop means that one would be better off with a less noisy ISO or without a tripod.Secondly price, 250$ price difference is a lot of money.Thirdly there are people who rightly swear by a L series lens but if you read the reviews online, much has been noted about this lens to be as sharp or better when compared with the 17-40L.4thly you get a good warranty of 6 years.5thly the excellent reviews here, [...], the-[....]and many other placesSo taking everything into consideration and the fact that some people complained that there is a QA issue with some of this lens, i thought to take the plunge and replace it with another copy if i got a faulty one.After getting this lens: Its tack sharp and i mean its as sharp as the nifty-fifty (50mm f/1.8 II) and gives me real good DOF. It has a nice bokeh (more circular) not the hexagonal (or was it pentagonal) one gets with the nifty-fifty. As a walkaround lens it is just great. And also if i feel bored to change to the nifty-fifty this usually is my choice of taking a potrait photo.There is always an uncertainty factor when buying a non-canon lens but this lens is better in both ability and money wise than the L series counterpart. Plus you get a hood included (a 50$ one if you consider how overpriced canon hoods are)BTW is you are looking for a nice polarizer to complement. Consider the Tiffen 67mm Circular Polarizer which is a good fit and does the job just fine and with almost no vignetting and loss of light.Update(after a year of Extensive use): Probably the best $400 i ever spent. This lens taught me everything about bokeh and how to take fantastic photos. With over 5000 photos taken using this lens in museums, zoos, indoors, outdoors, it never ceases to amaze me. I keep it on about 95% of the time only time and again using a zoom lens for far off shots. Much recommended for a starter!\n",

      "This is for the \"Tamron SP AF 2x Pro Teleconverter for Nikon Mount Lenses\". However, I feel the review has pertinent information for canon-mount TCs too.I have attached a picture of the newly designed nikon-mount 2x TC in customer pictures above (again, I know this is page is a canon-mount product but the info applies to both types)First, I wanted to give everyone a heads-up. The pictured item for this product (as of today 5/13/11) is white with a black rubberized grip on it. However, recently Tamron changed the style of the teleconverter to be all black. I confirmed this with Tamron directly (you can too - 1-800-827-8880) and the rep said that as long as the teleconverter has a model number 300F on it that it's the correct \"pro\" 2x teleconverter as opposed to their lower-end 2x teleconverter.As to my experience with the product, the quality and build seems great. I've always been impressed with Tamron as an alternative to pricier lens companies. I'm using it primarily with a Tamron 18-270 PZD VC lens and the extra reach is incredible (at full tele with the D90 crop factor the lens' 35mm equivalent focal length is 820mm!!). When attached to my Nikon D90 body, however, the Vibration Compensation (VC) is a little spotty. It will work MOST of the time and stabilization efficacy doesn't seem to be affected, but on occasion the VC will just no longer activate. A very quick and easy fix for it is to just semi-detach and then reattach the lens/telconverter (don't have to fully remove) and voila the VC works again -- if only for a little while. Strange issue, but not too much of a hassle.When I contacted Tamron about the VC issue the representative informed me that it is because this teleconverter is \"not compatible\" with any VC lenses (at least Tamron ones), which perhaps explains the sporadic functionality. However, I usually understand \"not compatible\" to mean \"doesn't work ever\" but my experience is that the VC on my 18-270 PZD VC works just fine -- just when it's in a good mood.Overall, I'm very happy with this teleconverter. Don't expect AF to work unless you're using it with a very fast lens because it attenuates the amount of light (basically, if your lens is a f/2.8, adding this TC makes it an f/5.6). And to my knowledge the majority of AF systems don't function well or don't function at all at apertures smaller than f/5.6 (feel free to correct me in the comments). That said, AF did work under bright conditions, so again it's not that big a deal.In short, you get a lot of extra reach, but you have to give up AF and VC sometimes. But there's no free lunch in the world and unless you want to drop a few grand on a fast tele lens, this is a good alternative for ~$250. But realistically if you're expecting to hand-hold an 800mm lens then perhaps your expectations need some reconsideration ;)\n",

      "I used the STE2 with two Canon 430EX Speedlites to do some portraits with excellent results.  I mounted the Speedlites on stands with 30 inch shoot-through umbrellas using hot shoe multiclamps.  I shot with a Canon 50mm f1/4 lens on a Canon 30D set to manual with a 1/60 shutter and f4 aperture.  With E-TTL enabled, the flash power is automatically adjusted to obtain the correct exposure.  I found the flash power to generally be right on but on the occasion I felt it wasn't, I simply adjusted the flash compensation on my camera.  I did not need to meter or use a gray card so I was able to focus more on composition.I really like the convenience of this wireless setup because there are no cables to trip over and that makes it really easy to move my lights around and try different angles.  With a two flash setup, you can easily change the ratio between the two flash units on the back of the transmitter without touching anything else.  This often helped me get better shots because I could quickly modify the light setup to capture a moment without stepping out from behind the camera.I would prefer radio control but this setup is very compact and I did not have any problems with the Speedlites not firing even if they were not quite in direct line of sight.  I even turned my shoot-through umbrellas around to act as reflectors, effectively blocking the line of site between the camera and the Speedlites, and they still fired so apparently there is a bit of flexibility in that line of site.Update 5/25/2007:  Although the STE2 worked well for portraits in relatively small rooms, I recently tried to use it for some wedding formals in large churches, reception halls, and outdoors and found it didn't work so well.  Even after putting in brand new batteries, I was quite limited on where I could position my flashes so they would still fire.  I had to have the flashes in front of me and just off to the sides for it to work.  I have since decided to purchase some radio slaves for my wedding work.  The other thing I noticed is that if you are shooting a bride in a white dress, E-TTL will tend to underexpose the shot so its value is diminished which makes non-TTL flashes and old-school metering for off camera formal work much more desirable.\n",

      "Got this as a Christmas present from my folks - wonderful!  Just put the batteries that come with the camera in - set the date by following the easy prompts and you're shooting pictures within 2 minutes of taking out of box.  I have used only the auto setting, and it's great!  Downloaded to my Dell 4600 computer  very quick and simple!! It uses the same transfer cord as my MP3 player and my Dad's Olympus camera so I only need one cord to download 3 different things!  So far, I'm very impressed!  It is bigger with the 4 batteries, but also provides a much nicer, easier grip - good for husbands like mine with bigger hands.The only things I don't like are only a small 128MB card is included and I'll defintely have to buy a bigger card.  Second, there is more of a delay than I'd like before flash recharges and you can take another picture, but i think that's a factor of price - this camera really delivers for the price - a faster shutter speed costs more and i don't really need that anyway!  It's not much slower than my olk Nikon 35 MM camera.  For amateurs like me who just want nice family photos, you can't go wrong with this camera!  I'll update my review if there's problems later, but I don't think there will be.\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "Let me start with the bad, and get the complaining out of the way.First, the CCD is a little bit on the noisy side, especially in low light situations. That said, I'm still surprised at the number of low-light, no-flash pictures that can be salvaged in Photoshop.Second, it has an artificial limit on video length - 30 seconds at 640x480 and 3 minutes at lower resolutions. I cannot see any good reason for this, as the A530 and A540 can record video until you run out of power or memory. Also, those later models will let you do \"digital zoom\" while shooting and this camera will not. The zoom ratio you start with is what you are stuck with for the entire video.Third, the flash recycle time is longer than I would like. This is probably due to the choice of two AA batteries as a power source, and it does not seem to be any better on my mother's A530.Fourth, the display is small. It's a small camera, deal with it. You can zoom in on a picture if you feel it's necessary to check it on the spot.Finally, it has significant barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom range. Most of the time you aren't going to notice, but it is visible and somewhat bothersome in architectural photos.These flaws rule out a five-star rating, but the camera still has plenty going for it.First, the optics are sharp, although I noted the distortion issue above. I do not get the purple fringing I have seen on some other cameras. I believe these optics went unchanged into the A530 and A540, which means they are probably overkill for a 3.2MP sensor. The f/2.6 maximum aperture is quite usable.Second, the flash is surprisingly good. The red-eye reduction doesn't work particularly well, but it never does with a flash this close to the lens axis (and you can fix that in the bundled software). I noted the cycle time issue, but I can't complain about the amount of light generated once it does charge.Third, it's not as hungry as some other cameras I've tried. I would tell you how long one set of NiMH AA batteries last, but I can't -- I've never been able to run them flat. I just pop in freshly charged batteries before every adventure and I'm good to go. The fact that it uses AA batteries also means you're never more than a trip to 7-11 away from a fresh charge, if the situation calls for it.Fourth, it's very versatile. The \"Auto\" mode is dead simple to operate, enabling macro focusing is a single button press, the zoom is very intuitive, the pre-focusing behaves exactly like you would expect from a larger camera, and it does shoot video with sound. At the same time, it has manual mode, Av and Tv modes, a rear-curtain flash sync mode, and many other ways to bend it far beyond mere snapshots. Simple when you need it, complex when you want it -- perfect balance. The mode wheel is a good, old-fashioned click wheel, so once you memorize where your favorite click stops are, you don't even have to look. As you would expect from a Canon camera, it also has 2-second and 10-second self-timer modes, so you can line up a family photo and have time to sneak yourself into it. The camera sits quite stably, so you can usually improvise a platform to use if you don't carry a folding tripod.Fifth, the included Windows software is pretty good. You don't absolutely have to use it, but if you don't want to, you pretty much have to use a card reader to transfer. Thus it's fairly important that the software is both easy to use and flexible enough to do most of the things you want.Sixth, it uses a standard \"mini USB\" cable to connect to the computer. This means that if you ever lose it, or wish to have a spare, you do not have to get a special part. Also, since so many other devices use the same style cable, you can (as I do) leave the cable permanently attached to the computer and attach devices to it as necessary. I have a webcam and MP3 player that use the same type of cable, so there's usually something attached.Finally, it has a removable ring around the lens to attach an adapter, allowing you to attach all manner of filters, wide and tele lens extenders, or whatever you would want to attach. The Canon adapter is also threaded to 52 mm, which is a very common filter size. If you have an old SLR, chances are you already own some 52 mm filters.If you are wondering if 3.2MP is enough and you wouldn't be better off with more megapixels, all I can say is this: If you don't know exactly why you need more than this resolution... you probably don't. I have been able to run 12\" by 18\" color laser prints from my pictures with quite acceptable quality -- do YOU have access to a printer bigger than that? I would not mind an upgrade to the A530, but only because of its significantly better video capabilities. More pixels in the same size sensor usually means more noise and longer save times between pictures, though admittedly you do not have to run at maximum resolution at all times. It generally is easiest though to shoot at the highest resolution and worry about reducing it after you get home.If you feel you need the enhanced capabilites of the A530 or A540 (for an additional $50-120, last I checked), then by all means buy one. You won't be disappointed. But if you want an inexpensive, pocketable camera that doesn't take cheap-looking pictures, you can't go wrong with the A510. All the accessories are the same, so if you decide to upgrade later, it is only the camera you have to buy.\n",

      "Having used some other low-end digital cameras in the past, I must say that this one is a welcome relief.  Most of these other cameras have what I feel is a critical flaw - a long wait between pushing the button and when the camera actually takes a picture.  Some of the other cameras can take as long as three seconds between &quot;clicking&quot;, and when the photo is actually taken.  While this doesn't sound like a big issue, I can guarantee that you'll end up with a lot of pictures of floors and ceilings with the other models - especially when someone unfamiliar with the camera pushes the button and then looks at the camera to see why nothing happened.  Of course, you can erase these errors without any cost involved as the camera's digital, but there's no guarantee you can replicate the moment you were trying to capture.  Thankfully, this camera eliminates this concern.  The resolution of this camera is certainly adequate for web and email pictures, and would be ideal for anyone who needs to take digital pictures for online auctions like ebay. Plus, it comes at a very affordable price for people who would like to experiment with digital photography.\n",

      "This is my second digital camera.  My first was the Olympus 340R which is still near perfect after 3 years of use.  I do a lot of outdoor photography and needed something with zoom capability.The pixels wasn't that big of a concern because the 1.3 mp of the 340R was suiting me just fine.  I run my 19&quot; montitor's resloution at 1600x1200 and the picture fills up the screen with awesome quality.The zoom on this camera is amazing.  It can take a picture of 8 pt text on paper from across the room (11 feet) and you can read it clearly.  It's also pretty amazing how lighting is composed.  Without the flash on, it still compensates for a lot of light.  I was able to zoom across the neighborhood for about 1500 feet at night and still get a good picture of cars coming down a hill.With my old camera I found that digital zoom is pretty much worthless unless you print straight from the card.  If you need the extra zoom, you can do it on your computer.  I tested this out:  I took a 27X zoomed picture and a 10X optical zoom of the exact same object.  On my computer I enlarged the optical zoom photo 300%. The detail was exactly the same in both photos.  When you only use optical zoom, you also get more overall picture.  What I mean my this is that you get more frame area to crop out if you need to, abling you to center the object easier.One feature that no one has mentioned yet is the ability to record 4 seconds of audio with each photo.  I find this really cool to mark my GPS location points.  I mark the position on my GPS, take the picture, and then record what GPS waypoint the picture is of.  The 4 second audio is only 32K on the card, so you won't even notice loss of space.  You can even go back and re-record or add audio to pictures already taken.When you play back the photos while connected to a TV, the audio plays with each photo.The stability is somewhat of an issue when zommed in, but I also found the &quot;action&quot; mode to elimate any bluring.A lot have mentioned the &quot;lens cap of doom&quot;.  It doesn't pop off the lense, it's held by a thumb spring. (mabe the older ones did just snap onto the lense, but my new one doesn't) It also comes with a retaining cord so it's no going anywhere.  The camera didn't have a specific place to attach the lens cap cord, so I wove it into the neck strap.  It's long enough that it doesn't stop the lens from pertruding out when turned on and you forget to take the lens cap off.Viewing taken photos on the LCD is very quick.  My 340R would take about 3 seconds to load each photo in to the LCD.  The C-700 is almost immediate, and you can zoom in 3X and pan freely around the photo.  After taking a picture, you can also view the last shot immediately and delete it if you want.  To do this, press the LCD button [] twice quickly.  I use feature this a lot because I like to show people the photo/video right away.The last feature I absolutely love is the USB connection.  I have a FlashPath (floppy disk reader) for my old camera, which won't be getting much use anymore.  The USB is pretty much as fast a reading from a hard drive.  A 4 meg video clip starts playing immediately straight from the camera.\n",

      "I've used one of these at work for over a year, and just bought one on clearance for home.  It may not be the latest and greatest, but it is the best monitor for the money.  It's attached to a fairly high end system and I run a few games on it.  Everything is razor sharp and clear.  I always have the brightness turned down on my monitors (my eyes are sensitive to light) so I can't address the complaints about \"not bright enough\".

I bought it to replace my gigantic 19\" CRT which had done its job well, but I needed more desk space.I started researching flat pannels around the net - looking for a 17\" with 16 ms response or less with a DVI input.  Not the cheapest monitors around by any means.  Then I found the Princeton here.  I'd never heard of Princeton before this purchase, so I did a good deal of research - mostly customer reviews.  I don't really care what random sites and magazines have to say, but when people who actually use it give it such great reviews, I figure I couldn't lose.And thus far, I haven't.  This monitor has excellent color, great response time for the games I've played (Half Life 2 among them), and no dead pixels.  The final kicker was the price - you won't find another monitor of this quality for this price.  And with the rebate, there's really no thought required.  Even without the rebate.The only downside I've noticed is on a pure black screen, you get some light around the edges, but with a normally lit screen, you'll barely notice it.\n",

No better price anywhere and thedelivery was excellent, even out here in the countryside.  I have no complaints about this television and I woulddo it all again with no hesitation.  You will find no regrets from me on this purchase, and believe me, if I felt Igot shafted you would be reading about it right now. Five Stars.  Remember, though, that High Def is the bighallmark of this screen.  Regular broadcasts are acceptable, but it is best to get further back from the screen.Also, you will need a High Def dvd player with a very expensive cable to go with it.....but the remarkable colorand definition you will see on such a large screen is still amazing me.\n",

      "I bought a Toshiba REGZA 47HL167 in April of 2008 (4 months ago) [...]. I waited a while before writing my review because I wanted to make sure the TV didn't die on me after a month of use. So far, I am pretty satisfied with the purchase. As some other reviews have stated, there is a slight color shift problem, however, it does not really bother me. I played with the color settings, and have found settings that satisfy me. However, I notice that some channels are more problematic than others (HGTV is way too red!).When I first received the TV there was a huge black shadow on the right side of the screen, but I sent it back and have not had the same problem with the replacement. I later discovered that the shadow was due to improper storage of the television whilst in warehouse.Picture Clarity:True, the Samsung does have a clearer picture (the whites are more vibrant), however, at the time of purchase, the Samsung was $900 more than the Toshiba. If you can get the Samsung LNT4665F for a cheaper price, than I would go with the Samsung. That being said, I think the picture quality of the Toshiba is wonderful for the price. I have a Sony PS3/blu-ray, and by connecting it with a cheap HDMI cable purchased from Amazon, the picture clarity is amazing! As mentioned in other reviews, the 1080p converts to 1080i in some instances, but I'm willing to compromise for the price.Matte Finish Screen:I am extremely happy with the matte finish screen, because when viewing television during the day there is absolutely NO glare! (Perfect for weekend afternoon sports!) Because of the way my living room is positioned, the windows have to be directly opposite of the television, causing a very bad glare on most TVs. However, with the matte finish, that problem has been solved! Wonderful!Remote control problems:The remote control is too big! However, I solved this problem by programming the TV into my satellite remote, so I use the Toshiba remote very rarely now. Unfortunately, I still have to use the Toshiba remote to switch in between inputs, and I've noticed that sometimes the arrow buttons don't work - very annoying! However, I think I may have gotten a defective remote, because I haven't seen any other reviews that complain about this problem.OVERALL:Overall, I am very happy with this television. It was a big purchase for me, and I'm glad I made the right choice!\n",

      "I bought this TV for myself as a Christmas present, and I love it so much! Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV. Its quality is probably about the same as those name brand sets that cost twice as much for the same size. I bought it from Target while on sale and even including tax the total price comes to less than $950 (shipping was free too).\n",

      "Pros: simplicity, build quality, reliability, flexibility, PandoraCons: still expensive, Pandora extra costI have been searching for a wireless audio system for my home for years. There have been virtually no choices at the $1000 level. The Sonos founders must have noticed. I am amazed that they got everything right the first time around. I ordered the BU130 bundle plus the Sonos speakers. The setup was simple. Connected one of the two units (either one will do) to my router (using wired connection). The router recognized it immediately and I was in business.The bundle comes with the 100 (amplifier included) and the 80 (no amplifier). The speakers turned out to be weak - would not get those again. If I had a choice, I would not get the 100 again because I don't need the amplifier. But, the package includes it and the package is cheaper than buying two 80s and a controller. You might find the four 10/100 etherports on the 100 useful (I didn't).I connected my media system to the 80's line input and I now can pipe that sound all over the house (no wires).  I just bought another bundle to add more rooms.This system is just crazy rich. Besides the obvious flexibility of line-in from any of the units, Sonos includes 30-day trials of Pandora and Rhapsody. If you've ever tried Rhapsody, you may find it hard to go back to radio (broadcast or Internet). Unfortunately, you'll have to pay for it after the 30 day trial. Pandora is basically like satellite radio. I'm not hooked, yet. Sonos also delivers a broad selection of Internet radio genres. All of this is selected from the fantastic remote. Be sure to spend the extra $40 for the cradle.One last comment. When I first set the system up, I was concerned that the range would be limited. I've had it all over my house, in every room and closet and upstairs far, from the server. No problem.\n",

      "This device (Samsung Helix) is a great way to get Xm radio anywhere.  I have been traveling for work throughout the summer, and have been in roughly 10 different states, from the East Coast to the Midwest, all from my home base in California.  I have found only a few very rare places where I could not get a usable signal from the unit itself; when you plug in the extended antenna (included), you can get signal anywhere.  I drove trucks in various states and just slapped the antenna to the roof and I was good to go.  I loved being able to listen to virtually any style of music (my tastes run from rock to classical), with the addition of a number of comedy channels (best when you have a hard day and need something to cheer you up).  In the Los Angeles area and virtually any other large city, you can walk around with this unit and get clear signals virtually anywhere. The ability to instantly record something you like or have it tell you when something you like is playing on another channel is very cool.  The battery life is good for about five hours, which is not the best, but when you use a car charger it all works out.Do not buy the Samsung car charger, though. It costs about $75.  You can get a small inverter for your car power port that will cost you about $25 and do the same thing!Also, this Samsung unit is the exact twin of the Pioneer Inno, but costs tons less, for some reason.\n",

      "I've always loved this equalizer in friends' cars over the years. Yes, it's been around for many years! In fact, when I printed out the manual for it from Clarion's website, it is dated on each page 12/02/2005 (and I know for a fact this was around long before 2005). When Clarion makes a good thing good, they keep it out there and continue to sell them for as long as people will buy them. Thank you, Clarion! Another example of this is their world-famous crossover, the MCD360. I have had two of those, and love them! I'm more of a Kenwood freak when it comes to head units, amps, and speakers. Kenwood used to be famous for having the best frequency response of speakers out there, but that's been changing over the years. Clarion in beating them these days in the speaker specs. Also, Kenwood doesn't make a trunk mount crossover. Clarion does!Okay, so now for my review.To begin with, it looks beautiful tucked under my head unit! I'm lucky enough to be able to change the colors of my buttons on my deck, so I can match the deep rich blue of the knobs on the Clarion equalizer. Sweet!I could go on and on about how awesome my stereo sounds since I added the EQS746, but you can probably already imagine. Of course it brings out the highs (which I love... highs!) and mids like nothing on the planet.The BAD thing I do NOT like about this equalizer? The location of the fader knob! It's to the right of the power button, right there among the 7 band adjustment knobs. Makes it hard sometimes to reach down and adjust the lowest crossover point of the 50 Hz band. In my opinion, they should have put the fader knob to the LEFT of the power button. But I'm sure they won't change it just for me. LOL!I totally agree that they also should have used a lower low-pass crossover selection than 60/90 Hz. I think 20/40 would have been nicer.Before I bought this equalizer, I shopped around and did a LOT of comparisons. I knew I wanted a half-DIN model mounted under my head unit. Among the ones I decided between were the Clarion EQS746 (7-band), Audio Control 4.1 (4-band), Precision Power e-Dz (7-band), Audiobahn AEQ-6Q (6-band) and the discontinued (but still able to find on ebay sometimes) Kenwood KGC-6042A (9-bands plus 2). After doing a ton of research, and comparing frequency controls and other cool features, I went with the Clarion.Try the Clarion EQS746 and you WILL be hooked! You'll understand the first time you power it up and tweak the frequencies why it's so highly rated in reviews all over the internet!\n",

I use this when I walk on my treadmill and am watching TV at the same time, and it keeps slipping off my ears. Not a big problem though, and I wish they had created a method to increase the tension in the headset mechanism so it would hold tighter.

      "This receiver was much deeper than the old Technics it replaced, so I had to relocate it to the center cabinet, on the top shelf above our very nice Samsung lcd TV (&lt;3 Samsung). Running the wires was, by far, the hardest part with the setup at my parent's house, because they have this big, fancy, wooden set of entertainment cabinets pressed within 8 inches of the back wall, so it is tricky moving a lot of cables around back there.Well, we have just gone from 5.1 surround to 9.1 surround with this sucker, (if you count the Presence speakers). Two Bose 301 Series bookshelf speakers  serve as the front mains, then there are 7 Klipsch speakers - 4 in the upper corners of the room (presence and rear surround) and two more, placed halfway back, along the sides of the room (known simply as the surround speakers). I haven't really tested whether the presence speakers do much yet (depending on the DVD, of course), but the side surrounds really add to the experience and allow effects from the DVD to be placed more accurately around you.I believe that Yamaha is known for the quality of their Receiver/Amplifiers and so far I don't have any doubts. The auto-setup works well as a starting point and seems to be very perceptive (accurate) in measuring the speaker distances. It also checks the speakers against cross-wiring, which is a nice touch... I did not even know it, but the rear left surround had been crossed since forever, and this little, I mean big, guy brought it to my attention! I really like the feature set this thing has. You can set the initial volume when it is powered up, as well as set the maximum volume allowed, so it will never be possible to accidentally crank the volume too high and blow your ears or a speaker out. I did have an issue with the pre-out for the sub... it didn't seem to always be \"on\", with certain sound programs (8 channel enhanced audio), so I also wired the sub from the front speaker leads and this lets it work consistently, regardless, and therefore sound better. I will have to look into that again, as to why the .1 was not utilized, or did not seem to be working, for the 8 channel enhanced audio program.I may write more later, but overall I am pleased and impressed and it is what I expected from Yamaha. I probably wouldn't trust another brand.\n",

The other factor to consider in this kind of application is that it is a little wide so if you have other jacks next to the jack you plug this into then you can't get to them because this blocks them. other than that it serves its purpose.\n",

      "January 2005: I purchased this PDA to replace my now dead CLIE T615C which was great. The first one I bought (from Buy.com) had the alarm problem that others have mentioned. I called Palm support which is now outsourced and horrible who told me to do a hard reset and try again...same issue after the hard reset after which time I sent the PDA back to Buy.com. I bought my second one from Palmone.com. I figured I'd be better off buying it from \"the source\" directly. Same alarm problem, hard reset and all. The alarm only sounds a fraction of the tone so you can easily miss it. The alarm only works properly when the unit is turned ON. I have several peers with the Tungsten E and EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE THIS ISSUE. I emailed Palm support with this info, figured maybe there is a firmware or OS update. Their response?....do another hard reset and if it does not work return it for another. %()&^%$!!!!! Not this time!All in all, aside from this, I actually happen to like this PDA. OS 5.2.1 is a nice upgrade from OS 4 from my Clie. The screen resolution is excellent. The MP3 player sounds great with nice headphones or buds. I have NOT had the \"noisy screen\" issue.The lack of a cradle and 2 seperate cords for charge and sync I consider only a minor inconvenience. I use a Krusell leather case so I don't worry about the fingerprints others complain about.Oh, and for the record I downloaded a program called \"emerald sounds\" from freewarepalm.com. This replaces the system MIDI sounds so you can put a louder and longer tone into the alarm so you are more likely to hear it.One more thing; if I had to rate Palms support now I would give it ONE STAR and that would be generous. It has gone down the tubes since the days of my Palm IIIxe!! But then again, Sony's PDA support is/was notiously poor as well.In the end, the Tungsten E is a nice PDA for $190-$200. I wonder if the more expensive Tunsten or Zire's have the alarm issue???UPDATE April 2006. My PDA still works nicely but over the long haul 2 notable issues: Battery life is poor, need to charge every 2 days (may not be THAT bad after 15 months!) Also the screen NOISE, oh yes it is there BIG TIME. But then again, now that I am aware of it I hear it on NEW Tunsten E2's in the stores!\n",

      "For the last few years, I've been happily using a Garmin Streetpilot C330 (which I call \"the nanny\" because I use the stern, authoritative British voice, which reminds me of Mary Poppins). The one thing I really missed was the street-name announcements. I know it seems lame, but where I drive (eastern Massachusetts) there are so many intersections with multiple branches that a simple \"turn left\" doesn't always tell you which street to take. So, when I saw the C340 on sale (not here) for under $200, I decided to go for it.So far, it lives up to its expectations. For those who complained that they never got a GPS signal when they first used it, it's important to know that it sometimes takes a long time for that initial \"orientation.\" My 340 took about 8 minutes to locate the satellites when I took it outside, but once it did it's grabbed them consistently within 30 seconds every time I turn it on. While the audio quality is a tad less clear (a bit more \"machinelike\") than the 330, I would assume this is because the 340 has to use so much more of its voice processing for the street name announcements. This feature in itself really is wonderful, and well worth getting any GPS that offers it.I haven't compared the 330 features to those of the 340. I'll never use SD cards, but it's a nice feature. I do recommend that you get the optional weighted dashboard mount--unfortunately, it's the only option available for the 3xx series other than the suction mount, which is completely worthless. Apparently, the third party GPS mount vendors don't feel it's necessary to create a mount for this series. I can't say how it works in the city, but I do know that my 330 rarely lost a signal in anything other than a tunnel, even in New York City. If you really have problems holding on to the signal, getting an external antenna might be a better solution than deciding to upgrade to the c530, which may have a better receiver but doesn't come with text to speech.Sometime I would like to try the live traffic feature, but I don't use it enough to justify the extra receiver and cost, but it's nice to know that I can do so. It's also nice that the 340 includes the 2008 City Navigator maps, so I won't need to upgrade this year.Overall, the 340, since it will likely be discontinued soon, is a great value if you can find it for under $200 new. It's definitely a step up from the 330 and is perfect if you don't need all the bluetooth/MP3/added nonsense of some of the other GPSs out there.\n",

      "I was looking for a means to convert some of my VHS collection (namely Centennial) to DVD. I had looked in to several systems, and am no complete amateur, as I have done video conversions since my Amiga days over a decade ago. I recently bought a new computer system with a USB2 port and a DVD burner, so I figured now was the time. I read bad things about the other Dazzle systems, but this one had good reviews. They were right. Within minutes of receiving and opening the box I was feeding the video into my computer and ready to burn the DVDs. I have since burned quite a few. It's almost idiot proof. The quality is not exceptional, but it is quite good for home movie conversions for those that are not perfectionists. You must have a USB2 port, and that seems to be adequate speed. You also should specify and remember where you want the output to go, or it tends to hide files on your drive, taking up quite a bit of space. Very simple to use, and fun to play around with. One thing. I use Nero to do the actual DVD burn. The burn function in Pinnacle take forever. No big deal to me, but might be to others. Also, maybe I've had no problems because I have an up-to-date system, with XP SP2, 3.4GB P4 CPU, etc. One more thing...I am stationed in Germany and Amazon would not ship to me! I had to order through J&R, but got it way quicker than I ever have through Amazon, and at a better price. Wonder why they won't ship item to an APO? Okay, maybe should only be 4 stars, but I really do like its ease of use.\n",

      "I've had my Vision M for a few months now. I upgraded from a Zen Micro. I'm sticking with Creative. Why? The main reason is they do not use a proprietary format. I can copy MP3s from my computer right to the Vision drive, without the stupid conversion process that Ipod and others use. I have to admit, I do not use the video capabilities. The idea of watching a movie on the screen just doesn't make sense to me. I do have pics stored and will go through them while listening to music on a plane trip. The Vision is easy to use, has good sound (especially if you buy a decent pair of head phones), and holds ALOT of music. I mostly have it plugged in to an MP3 capable alarm clock (through a mini-jack cable), and use it to listen to music to while I fall asleep. The automatic off mode is great for this.Easy to use, and user friendly. I also have to admit I got mine on EBay, as I have all the accessories. Way less expensive than Amazon.Check it out.\n",

      "I did my homework, and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model, I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it.  I have used trackballs before to a limited extent, and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow, but I wanted something that would better match my Mac.  Well, forget about that. The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use...I had cleaned it several times in the first week, and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned.  I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place. After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON.  It is pretty, it SHOULD work better, but after thinking it over I ditched \"matching\", went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse. It is a great fit for my hand, and now resides on my desk.  The marble mouse is cheaper too, which is odd.  If I hadn't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON. Your options aren't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go, which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal, unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed.\n",

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not techie, but I can be pickie, (he prefers to call me a demanding customer), so he takes that into consideration when buying our equipment. When we feel the need to replace our keyboard this is the one we go to time and again.  We like the split keyboard as it is more ergonomic than a standard keyboard and I have been known to spend quite a bit of time on the internet and on the computer in general, so having a good sound keyboard is important. I love the programmable favorite keys so I can navigate to my favorite sites quickly, pick up email at the touch of a button or hit the calculator key if there isn't one hanging around our computer room. It maybe isn't the quietest keyboard in the world, but that is the only thing that I could even remotely call a \"con\". Installation was a piece of cake, not difficult at all.  Overall a good keyboard that is well constructed and a good value.\n",

      "This mouse works great and 10 buttons on a mouse is awesome.  And being able to reprogram all of them is a great feature by Logitech.  I have had no issues in lag or accuracy from the mouse.  For those that do, change your batteries and go into SetPoint and adjust you mouse settings, not that hard.I have even used this mouse for gaming, mainly Dawn of War and CS.  Worked perfectly and you can reprogram the buttons to help.They only thing with my particular mouse is that the email, messanger, and battery lights do not seem to fuction.  In all reality, this does not bother me at all, and probably saves some battery life.  I dont know if I somehow disabled the email and messanger since I reprogrammed the email to open FireFox and the messanger to open Picasa2.  The battery light I guess would be nice but since its covered by your hand, what is the point?  You can always check your battery level in SetPoint and I am working on a Widget to show the battery level.I formerly used the Microsoft Trackball (which until I have used this was my favorite mouse, bought in ~1997).  I like the layout of the forward/back buttons on that mouse but have been unable to find anything like it.  I was a little concerned about the forward and backwards buttons being only usable via the thumb but this concern quickly vanished as I began surfing the web.  I will miss my trackball though.  (The logitech trackball only has 2 buttons, but is wireless)The ergonmic design of the this mouse is very nice.  I have a \"normal\" size palm for a guy but shorter, stockier fingers but this mouse still fits nicely in my hand campared to other mice.Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  I didnt buy from amazon but from a retail store.  FYI to, the MX 620 is not as nice as the 610 which dosent make a whole lot of sense to me.\n",

      "Deep keystrokes that feel and sound just right, as close as the old clicky IBM keyboards did but without the ear-raping. Key spacing and travel is excellent for large hands like mine (YMMV). There is no flex and the plastic is solid. I like that it has absolutely zero frills and that they key layout is exactly as it used to be. I don't use the media keys but I'm sure they're wonderful.As mentioned by another reviewer, having to press the Function key each time you start up the computer in order to use the F keys is annoying, but I've been using this keyboard for 5 years now and it's no longer an issue. If anything, the problem is that the Sleep key is right next to the Function activator, so you may mis-strike and accidentally hibernate the system. But again that has never happened to me; just pay attention.A white keyboard means two things: (1) it'll get dirty; and (2) the keys won't fade as it does on the black ones. Since dirt can be removed but faded-out black plastic can't be revarnished, I always choose white keyboards over black ones (and if you think that's racist, you've got a problem!).Please, Logitech, bring these back onto the market! I need more for my other computers where I'm stuck with your crappy latest products...\n",

      "I have had this mouse for a while now, and my dad just purchased one for himself.To start off, i have not had any problems with it yet (maby 1 1/2 years old).It is USB compatible, but works fine with the other adaptor.I use this with a mouse pad, and it has perfect response.Without a mouse ball, it requires a lot less effort, and does not get \"old\".  By old i mean that after a while of use the parts inside a ball mouse would collect stuff, and would cause the mouse to lock up at times.The only thing i do not like, but can easily suffer with, is that1)  The mouse is symmetrical (ment for use with both hands).  I am used to the old right handed microsoft mouses, and this isn't as designed to my hand as the old one.  But still works fine.AND2)  The Scroll Wheel is very free moving, where as my old microsoft mouse was harder to move.  I do find that i might accidentally move the wheel, and when playing games it can get a little bothersome.  I have got used to it though, and now i just go very gentle.This is worth the [money] any day.  The box set which offers this optical mouse and internet keyboard is also a consideration, for i like the keyboard just as much as this mouse.This mouse isn't even comparable to a IBM or Logitec mouse.~Hope this helps\n",

      "Well, after a fair amount of prodding and poking - I've got it working. Here's the deal:I bought this to provide wireless conncetivity for a Mac Mini that wasn't equipped with an airport card. While I love Mac's - the other options (USB wireless, etc) generally are problematic.The setup software that comes with the unit is Windows only so I had to fall back to the web-based setup system. This requires various jiggering with your IP addresses and such to allow you to connect to configure the box. Once you're in the configuration system - expect a pretty darn lean experience. In fact - there is actually no way to know if you have connected to your router/access point at all. You're forced to go back to the client machine and see if the connection is working. This is a serious hassle when the Belkin is set up for a different network range than you are trying to configure it for.So, dragged out the windows box and got it configured. But - no joy. I can ping to my hearts content - but cannot resolve domain names. For some reason the box does not pass the ID of the DNS server back to its client. Once I figured that out and hard coded that in the Mac - all is looking good.So, I'd say if you're using Windows and this works out of the box - you're golden. If there's a problem - expect to be doing a LOT of black box troubleshooting.And, it's kinda ugly as well.Sigh.\n",

      "I've been using this product for about a year.  I bought it specifically to use with a single drive for backing up my main PC.Taking it out of the box and getting it set up was very easy and straightforward.  I had it working within a few minutes.  Everything seemed to work the way I wanted it to.  A couple of days later it got very slow and un-responsive.  I would try to connect to one of its network shares and it would literally take 5 minutes to refresh the folders in any directory.  This was obviously unacceptable, so I made sure I had all the latest firmware and contacted support.  After exchanging numerous e-mails, they determined that the hardware was bad and I should send it back to be replaced.In the meantime I had discovered a 3rd party Linux firmware for the device called Unslung (NSLU2-Linux).  Since Linksys had said it was hardware, I figured I'd give the Unslung firmware a quick shot just to make sure.  I installed the Unslung firmware and it started working great and continues to work great until this day.  The basic Unslung firmware has all of the same web configuration pages that the stock Linksys firmware has, but it actually works properly.  Linksys may have released better firmware since, but I've been using the Unslung firmware ever since and haven't looked back.In summary, it's a really nice device.  It's small and convenient, and is easy to set up and get working very quickly.  You can do full or incremental scheduled backups from windows/samba shares without any software on the PC.  The only thing holding me back from rating it 5 stars is the performance problems with the stock firmware.  If you buy this, I would highly recommend updating to the latest Unslung firmware.\n",

First off, the transfer speeds are extremely SLOW!!! It would take you days or weeks to upload movies and music since you have to do it over the network. The NIC is only 10/100, but even with that you still only get about 3MB/s max!!! It has 2 slots for internal hard-drives but you cannot copy directly from one to the other! You cannot copy external USB directly to the hard-drives, you must do it over the NET and map drives. You think is too slow and want to connect the hard-drive to you PC to transfer files? Forget about, since the hard-drive is formatted to only read the NAS! Transferring files is unsafe over the NET since it only support FTP! Trying to remote in over the NET using [...] is the ultimate challenge, good luck with that! The device is not 100% bad. It do have some features like, UPNP and remote access, but there are others that are better, faster, safer and has more features. Do some research before buying one!\n",

      "This drive is cavernous and fast with USB 2.0. I presume it is even faster with ESATA which I will use when I upgrade to a new motherboard next month.  Contained in slick and compact packaging with a high-tech look.This purchase is my second FreeAgent 750GB.  I loved the first one so a reapeat was in order.I have one attached to my livingroom computer so the attractive case makes a bold statement.  The other contains a full backup of everything on my Desktop and Laptop that wasn't covered in system drive backups I have made separately.  The compact design helps me fit the backup drive into a fire safe that is already stuffed with documents.This product just misses 5 stars because the drive case can get slightly hot after prolonged use.  It doesn't seem to affect performance but I wonder how long these drives will last under such warm conditions.  Additionally I need to disconnect the drive upon reboots because it causes my Asus P4P800 motherboard to hang after posting bios if it is connected by USB.  It's a minor issue and in fact probably has more to do with the bios than anything that is at fault with the drive itself.The on/off button lacks adequate feedback to be effective, but I seldom feel the need to power on or off because of the auto-sleep features of the drive.  Also there are few indicators of read/write status.  I believe that the amber light does change intensity ever so slightly during access but it is so slight that I only noticed it when i had the pair of drives next to one another and could spot one was brighter than the other during access.  It beats having a light constantly blinking on and off but I would appreciate some notification of drive access.Like many of my reviews on Amazon I have nitpicked even the slightest of issues.  Nevertheless I highly recommend this drive for it's many excellent qualities which easily trump the shortcomings.  If you have any doubts, realize that I could have chosen any other drive in the World but I returned to purchase a second FreeAgent 750.\n",

      "The literature that comes with the drive would suggest it's just plug and play, but it's not that easy.On my Dell 4100 with ME, it required four hours of work to get it recognized. First, they don't tell you that in ME, you have to go into device manager and mark the drive \"remote.\" Even then, it took several resets and more monkeying around and another call to support to get the computer to recognize the drive.Next comes formatting. ME wouldn't recognize it as formatted. After formatting, ME wouldn't recognize the drive -- said insert disc. More resets. Then it required Scan Disc. And Scan Disc crashed during the process.More resets. Finally started working, but it has slowed down the system. I'm using USB 2.0 and it is dog slow on writes and reads.To make matters worse, Amazon doubled the order when it sent it to SimpleTech. So I get 2 drives and have to return the second one. SimpleTech supplied an RMA number, along with a warning they would not be responsible for any damage to the drive or loss of the drive in shipping if I didn't insure it. Why should that be my problem?I wish I'd bought a WD. The tech couldn't tell me what brand drive is inside the case. Kind of scary having 232 GB of data on a drive you don't even know who made.\n",

Other than that, there's not much you can say about a hard drive... most of the time you don't care about it, until it crashes!  That's why it makes sense to go for the best quality drive you can find, and that would be the Seagate.While the drive comes with software to migrate your old operating system to the new drive, be warned that it's hard to get a clean migration.  I tried this twice, and some things kept getting scrambled in the registry.  I finally decided to just reload the operating system from scratch and copy the data files over (made the new drive the master, and the old drive the slave; the documentation explains how to do this, it's easy).  A fresh installation is probably for the best anyway, as registries tend to get gunked up over time.  Keep in mind that your operating system installation CD may not recognize the full 160GB (my older WinXP Pro CD only saw the first 131GB, until I loaded SP2 later), so you may wind up with a second partition.

It was disabled as a factory default and nothing in the manual nor on WD web site was pointing in that so simple setting problem.BTY, WD web site has only 10 FAQ and the customer support is open only during US business hours, so for me, it is hard, I can do this only after business hours.

      "This disk drive couldn't be any easier to use.  Mine was refurbished and didn't come with any documentation or a power adapter.  However, I didn't need any instructions or an extra power supply to get it working.Keep in mind I use a desktop and a laptop with Linux (Ubuntu and Xandros respectively) as my operating system.  The cd/dvd drive works right out of the box without the need for any installations.  This might not be the case for Windows users, although I have used it successfully with my parents' XP desktop every time.  With that said, I've burned music, video, and data files to cd-r and dvd-r/+/-rw as well as ripping music, video, and data from cd's and dvd's.  The only problem I've encountered is when I try making an iso file from a dual layer dvd.  It reads dual layer dvd's fine, but it always fails when trying to make an iso file from them.  I'm not sure if it's a hardware problem or a firmware problem, but I have as of yet not been able to remedy this.  As a side note, I haven't tried burning to dual layer disks, so I'm not sure how well the drive can handle them.Certain usb ports may not feed the drive with enough power.  All ports on my desktop power it up fine, but one port on my laptop doesn't.  So if your drive doesn't power up, you may just need to reconnect to a different usb port.Lastly, the build could be a little better.  The plastic feels quite thin, especially the roof of the drive.  Even just a little bit of pressure is enough to depress it and prevent proper closing of the disc tray.Anyway, the pros far outweigh the cons.  If you need an ultraportable disc drive with writing capabilities, you cant find a better price than this.UPDATE 03/14/2014:After 6 long years of reliable service, this drive has finally given up.  A few months ago it started to have problems spinning up and reading discs, and just this evening it no longer starts up at all.  Truth be told, the last three years I've relegated it as a backup since I've purchased a laptop with a built in disc drive.  It's only seen intermitten use, but I've been very rough with it--tossing it into a storage ottoman after each use, pushing it aside if it's in the way, letting it roll around with other gadgets in storage.  But even when I still had my eeePC, I've ripped entire dvd collections--Invader Zim, Fate Stay Night, Last Airbender, Record of Lodoss War, and more--as well as countless music cd's using this drive with only a few failures.  I paid sixty-five bucks for this back in '08, and it was money well spent.  This is going for twenty or so dollars now, and well, I'm not gonna hesitate to buy another one.  UPGRADED to 5 stars.  It's price and reliability deserves it.\n",

      "The receiver and CD player are wonderful. The speakers, unfortunatelly not. They lack bass response and the imaging is just not there. The built quality of the speakers is cheap -- particle board, bare in the back! It's obvious they just don't match the rest of the system.It used to be different - before there was PS-509 system (which I have been using for 4 years). It has the same receiver and CD changer units (just black, not silver, however later they introduced PS-510 which was silver). PS-509/PS-510 shipped with Polk RT-105 speakers that were quite good (actually, according to Polk Audio, they were made by Onkyo, Polk just helped them with the design and allowed to use Polk name for marketing). Apparently in order to cut costs they ended the joint-venture and started to bundle the system with their mediocre speakers. PS-509 originally cost $500, MC35TECH is one hundred less (or even less than that).My advice -- get the receiver and CD player (you can get refurbished ones cheaply) and get some better speakers. For less money you'll get a better system. That's what I am doing now as I want to get another set.What else?The remote is hard to use. But at least it lets you adjust bass & treble settings (not possible without remote; some other functions are also available only thru the remote).The wake-up timer is very lame. It just turns the unit on without adjusting volume, so if you use the sleep timer to fall asleep with the music, you can't really use the wake-up timer. Also if you use CD for the timer, it will just play the last CD that was played with track 1. The bottom line is the wake-up timer is pretty much useless.Also, there is no balance adjustment, but the acoustic presence makes up for that reasonably well.Bottom line: the sound quality is unbelievable. Speakers are mediocre at best, but still much better than typical consumer stereos. This is much better value (and sound quality) than comparable offerings from Denon & Yamaha.\n",

The first thing to remember is this is not Palm OS, this is windows CE and that makes all the difference.I am a teacher and use my Jornada every day for tasks and for fun. First it does all the things you would expect of a PDA and does them very well. But then the real fun starts. I constantly use audio books and ebooks.  Audio books alone can justify the expsense. For a song at audible.com I subscribed to science friday for a year. The ISB cable makes transfering large files to a storage card, quick and painless. Now I can listen to this wonderful program on my schedule as well as any other audio book. The MP3 player is great, as good as it gets. Ebooks are a real pleasure. I have a 3d shooter game now that beats anything I have seen on a small screen.So for the price of 400 dollars you end up getting a PDA like Palm. PLUS the portable entertainment center with MP3, audio books, avantgo, and ebook reader. PLUS wonderful utilites like Word, Excel, and Microsoft Money.I have emailed Jornada support twice, they responded both times the next day with the exact information I needed. Note I was not having problems with the Jornada I just had questions about getting the most out of my compact flash card. I did have a Compaq Aero before this, and it just died after a couple of months. The same thing happened to my friend who bought one. I have had the Jornada for about 5 months with no problems and excellent support.HP is the world leader in calculators in my mind and that expertise has obviously carried over to handheld PCs. This product is a jewel among the ever growing world of new high tech introductions we are bombarded with every day. In my mind it was THE product of 2000. If you want to buy one high tech item that will change make your life richer this year, this is the one to get.  Just a note, to take advantage of the full power of the Jornada you need to buy a compact flash memory card but these are coming down in price every week.\n",

      "Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the \"best value in a mid-size Android tablet\" category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined \"reader\" and \"Android tablet\" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the \"Nook Today\" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just \"back\" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can \"override\" the Nook UI and install other \"launchers\" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9\" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy \"HOME\" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice \"soft touch\" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a \"sleeper\" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.  A 5 star item for features, design, performance, and value.\n",

      "I bought this cable several months ago in order to watch my own programs when I go to a cheap hotel (professors can't afford the Sheraton!) in Europe or South America where there is a TV set in the room but no cable stations, which limits the programs to three or four channels (even in London!)This is a very simple device.  Just plug one end into the Archos earphone out jack, plug the other end with the white, red and yellow composite connectors to the TV's video in, and voil&agrave;.  But don't forget to press the TV button (just right of the \"on/off\" button on top of the 604) otherwise you won't see anything!There is a caveat, however.  Most recent DVDs have a stupid code preventing pirating (that real thugs and honest knowledgeable folks manage to override, but average decent people are poisoned by it!) and in this case you won't be able to see your DVD elsewhere than on your small Archos screen, even if you paid for it, as I always do.  This is the case for Loreena McKennitt's \"Nights from the Alhambra\" and both of my Sarah Brightman's concerts (\"Live in Las Vegas\" and \"Diva\" -I wrote a review for this last one) which is the reason why I don't expect to buy any other of their DVDs, even though I found a way to get around this inconvenience.  I do this in three steps:1) I record the protected DVD into my laptop using a device called \"ADS Instant DVD\" instead of recording it to the Archos2) Then, I convert the Windows file to the \"Pocket PC\" format using \"Windows Media Encoder\" (free from MS website)3) Finally, I hook the Archos to the laptop, choose the \"Synchronization\" option and transfer the encoded file into the machine.  Now it works on a TV, no matter how protected it is!  Note however that if you just drag it or copy and paste it to the Archos using the PC link option it won't work: you must synchronize it with the 604.The only problem is that, if the quality is OK on the small Archos screen once it has been converted to the Pocket PC format, when you try to see this file on a big screen, it is not so good.  This is acceptable for a film but not really for a concert.Unfortunately, huge masterpieces such as \"Gone with the Wind\", \"Dr. Zhivago\" and \"Forrest Gump\" will not pass either on your TV, unless you convert them to the Pocket PC format as I already explained.Nevertheless, most of my films on DVD (whether older or newer) work fine on a large screen when recorded directly to the Archos 604 via the home DVR station and seen on a hotel TV using this video cable.  Among others, wonders such as Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole's \"Becket\", \"The Da Vinci Code\" with Tom Hanks, or Andy Garcia's wonderful \"The Lost City\", just to name a few masterpieces that everybody should own.  Especially Andy Garcia's outstanding film about the Cuban revolution, which was boycotted by Hollywood for mere political reasons and that every freedom loving person should buy!  On September 19, 2008 Amazon was selling it for only $11.49, which is an incredible bargain for a masterpiece.  Furthermore, it's eligible for free shipping!Also, my older films on VHS such as \"Love Story\" (another masterpiece that everybody should have!) can be seen on a big screen when recorded directly to the Archos, but newer VHS like \"Pretty Woman\" react like protected DVDs and refuse to read on my TVOn the other hand, with the exception of Loreena McKennitt, my two Sarah Brightman's DVDs, Andr&eacute; Rieu's \"The Homecoming\", and a couple of other concerts, most of my concerts on DVD also work on a large screen with fair quality.  Among others: Ren&eacute;e Fleming's wonderful \"Sacred Songs\"; Hayley Westenra in New Zeland; Bernstein's outstanding Christmas concert \"Ode to Freedom\" (Beethoven's 9th symphony, a collector's item!); \"Andre Rieu In Tuscany\", \"In New York\", \"In Vienna\", \"The Flying Dutchman\" and \"In Wonderland\" (a real wonder for this last one; it sure deserves that name!) and my two favorites with Ren&eacute;e Fleming's and Bernsteins's concerts: Celtic Woman 1 + 2 (\"A New Journey\", an outstanding concert for which you may read my review for Amazon, dated February 4, 2007 if you are interested).  Unfortunately, their third concert (\"A Christmas Celebration\", that I expect to review before next Christmas, when I finish my FIU students' corrections for this semester) is protected but their masterpiece (number 2) works OK.It is true, however, that the image quality is far from excellent, even on my small 20 inch Chinese stereo TV for which I paid $128, and even if I record an unprotected DVD directly to the 604 in AVI.  Using the home DVR station and a traditional composite cable with three connectors at each end will dramatically improve the image quality, but the DVR is bulkier to carry around and it needs a power source to work.  Nevertheless, this cable works fine for the audio part and I often use it to connect my 604 to my audio system, even when I'm home.But all in all, this is an excellent value for money at just under $15, which will allow you to watch your favorite films or concerts on a hotel TV, listen to music or audio books without carrying the DVR station around, or show the pictures of Uncle Archibald`s tenth wedding in Tahiti during your next family reunion around Aunt Agatha's turkey on Thanksgiving's Day.Before you go, let me add an interesting complement for those who like to travel light: the \"Archos Docking Adapter\" for $27 from Amazon as I write these lines.  This is a small device (tiny if compared to the DVR station!) that connects under the 604 and will allow you to recharge your machine with the included worldwide AC adaptor, hook it to another computer with the also included USB cable (but don't use the AC adaptor while linking the 604 to a computer, which will also charge it) and, most important, to add a USB drive like the Adata in 32 Gigs (currently under $60 from Amazon) with plenty of films and concerts in it.  At an average of 1 gig for a film recorded directly in AVI or only about 200 MB if converted to the PPC format, imagine how many films and concerts you may put into a 32 gigs device!  You can also hook an SDHC with a USB reader or a 32 gigs Compact Flash in a CF USB reader, although these last two solutions are much bulkier than the single USB drive in 32 gigs.Beware of multi slots card readers because they don't always work here!  As for external 2.5 inch drives powered by the USB, none of my five pocket drives, between 40 and 320 gigs, will work via the USB.  Your only option is therefore USB flash drives (my Adata in 32 gigs works very well), SDHC or CF in a USB reader.  With this \"Docking Adapter\", the memory of your Archos is extended to infinity.\n",

      "After reviewing people's comments, it seems that those who read the manual (so they know how to set it up and use all its features) get a lot out of the unit.  Those that don't know the unit's functions think it is so-so or lousy.Here is the bottom line: I bought 2 of the 250 GB versions; one for my brother and one for a friend.  Two weeks later both purchased 2 more themselves.  They loved it. Their wives loved it. Their kids loved it.I had already bought one myself of course, and although it has drawbacks, it is still the best high-definition unit recorder available.  You need to live an area where your antenna can pick up HD signals (or some other really good High-Def signal), but if you do and set it up right, the image quality beats anything off cable or either satellite service.For those comparing it to Tivo and others:1) This isn't a Tivo.  It has an over-the-air HD tuner that is just incredible, and pulls in channels my ATSC TV can't sort out.  I can receive 32 analog stations, of which about 9 have marginal, snowy pictures.  I get an astounding 41 digital channels, including all 32 analog duplicates, and the picture is better than DVD, and many include high-definition (1920x1080) channels with no compression artifacts.2) Tivo owns, and has successfully defended, software patents on the features people want the Sony to have. Sorry. It is legally impossible to duplicate their functions.  Do an internet search if you don't believe it.I think the \"TV guide\" interface of this Sony (for shows and programming) is not slick; but it works fine.  I can set it to record repeats of any show, M-F, one time only, daily, etc.  This works better than a typical VCR programming, and includes a lot of show information.  It DOES have search features (remember to read the manual before posting wild claims), and it does have some nifty features Tivo doesn't have; including some \"hot-keys\" on the remote for special shortcut functions.It also has user selectable \"skip commercial\" (forward and backward) buttons, allowing you to skip anywhere from 5-60 seconds in one click. I have mine on 30 seconds ahead and 10 seconds back on the remote.Best of all is the \"intelligent rewind\" when going fast-forward or fast-reverse.  What is that?Let's say you are fast-forwarding at 60x normal speed.  When you see what you like and push the play button, the unit doesn't stop at your over-shoot point. Instead it stops the fast-forward, calculates where you saw the image, and rewinds based on how fast it is going and how fast an average person can press the button.  This happens instantly, and instead of doing a lot of dancing with FF or RR to find the start of the show; this does it for you.Really clever, really useful; and you can custom set the delay for each speed too, just in case you are faster or slower than average.The unit isn't perfect. What is? I got my money's worth and whole lot more, but I can imagine people having problems if they don't read the darn manual!I really wish the unit had signal inputs like a VCR or DVD-Recorder; so be aware that it can record cable and antenna signals, but not inputs from other components.  However, all the outputs are \"hot\" at the same time, meaning I can output signals via the HDMI, and the SVHS and composite outs plus all audio outputs are sending a signal; allowing me to record to something like a DVD recorder if I want to off-line shows.It also has a nice variety of recording quality options so I choose what uses the most space and how good it looks, not all at one setting; and I set a recording's priority so if I ever run short on disc space the least valuable stuff gets deleted first; and I can \"lock\" recordings so they are never deleted.This was Sony's first foray into this area, so I can (sort of) understand the missing feature(s); but apparently they aren't making them anymore, and aren't making a version 2.  A shame really.  This unit blows away every other High-def recorder I've tried; and with some improvements could have taken a huge share of the market.Get one while you still can.  Digital TV isn't going away.\n",

      "Firstly, I've owned this product for 1 month now, and this product has been running for 1 month now without my touching it. So rest assured that this isn't your overnight overly excited review.----> Pros:1) The physical construction of the frame is beautiful, sturdy and solid. You will find no creeks on this frame, and the metal-frame itself is a real eye-candy, if you're into that sort of the whole futuristic white-metal look.2) The screen is very good, as others have pointed out. It's not as great as a HDTV screen, but it's definitely good enough to give the impression under broad daylight that it actually is a frame holding a picture.3) I actually found the use of the user interface (UI) to be particularly simple. I believe as long as you keep your mind open and not try to compare the UI to anything, you will quickly find out how easy it is to navigate through the menus.4) (MINOR) I consider it to be an upside when Im not forced to have to use the supplied program that came with the frame. When it comes to tech-stuff, I like to do things the manual way, so I'm not sure about you.----> Cons:1) (MINOR) The build of the buttons and joystick could have been a little better. There are minor annoyances when navigating throughout the UI. For example, if you're moving the stick left, it records as a push down on the stick instead. This is also due in part to the fact that the joystick is at the back and you cannot properly coordinate your joystick-push actions. It's really minor, nothing to get upset about, take my word for it.2) In a month of use, under certain SD cards, the slideshow would stop working. The SD card would not be read in the slot (SD card was a 1 GB Sandisk). I had to physically restart the product in order to get it going again, only to have this happen again after 20 ~ 30 hours of running? However, after changing into a 2GB Micro SD with the SD adapter (Made in Japan model), the frame has been running flawlessly for a month without problems, at all.3) (MINOR) Perhaps more internal memory could have been supplied? But I'm guessing if that were the case, the price of this product would have gone up further. I put this here because it may be an annoyance for some. It is not for me though.4) (MINOR) The turning leg-support at the back that allowed you to switch between landscape/portrait could have been designed with more angle flexibility in mind. Again, I put this here for those who are concerned. I do not find any problem with the way it is now.Having said that, I'd like to express my tips and tricks in knowing how to effectively use this product to its maximum potential.1) If you plan to have a lot of pictures without placing them in folders (Just the root of the card), format your card in FAT32. If not, you may not get past 250 pictures or so.2) DO NOT USE THE SUPPLIED PROGRAM. Simply copy your photos into the SD cards or whatever it is you're using and you're good to go.3) If you want to edit pictures, do it on your computer. Don't toy around with the pictures through the frame.4) Don't bother with the USB cable.5) Use Irfanview to mass-convert photos into the frame's natural resolution (720x540).My setup:- No folders have been used. All pictures are stored in the root position of my SD card.- It is set to turn on for 8 hours a day, and 12 hours during the weekends.- Running time : a month of going without having to adjust it for whatever reason.------I hope this has provided you with some sense of how this product is. Just remember, don't use the supplied program and you will be much happier with it. I understand that the CONS are longer than the PROS, but they're mostly just thoughts on how the thing could be improved upon for future versions. For myself, I absolutely love this product.Cheers.\n",

      "At the time this device was new, it was ahead of the game, pricewise and technology wise. Then palm came out with the 505, and now the palm 5.0 software and sony got out of the market quickly after only about 3 years.  I have had this handheld for a little over 2 years now, and it has done it's work.  It does have a nice bright color display, decent for display of a picture in the photo gallary.  It has the capability to run some programs from the memory stick, although I do not recommend getting a memory stick abouve 32mb becuase it takes forever to access programs on my 128mb card, often to were the handheld shuts off before I can open the program.  Also, the charger for the battery tends to wear out after a couple years, so the handheld will look like it's charging, but not charge at all. My office had bought about 20 of these, and a few have had problem with Infrared beaming, and mine the on/off button does not work.  Unfortunately, these were referbished models at the time, so who knows if the durability issue it the model or the referbished.  I do know some people with the fancier models that have had better long term luck. Finally, this handheld has limited internal memory compaired to new models (16mb), this can be difficult to update some applications on (epocrates for one). If their is an online update, I often find myself having to manually erase some of the old files on the handheld to free up enough space for it to accept the updated program.  But, for the time it came out, it was king. This item would be good for someone who wants a electronic calendar/datebook, also to carry a couple of pictures with them, but the business professional sould look towards the newer technology.\n",

      "We bought this from Amazon, along with a Garmin Nuvi 1490 LTM GPS scanner a few days ago. We knew the suction-cup mounting would not work because We have been frustrated with one of those suction-cups for almost three years now--with an older Garmin GPS receiver.This friction-mount does the job. It is very simple. Okay, dummy us, we did not initially know that we had to use part of the mount from the suction cup based solution into this one--and there were no instructions with this friction mount, none--but we figured it out quickly.The end result is a very simple and effective mounting solution. Perhaps even safer now that that both the GPS unit as well as the mount (which is quite bendable) can be fitted inside our Toyota Yaris' glove box.We live in the hilly areas of South Carolina; the 'Upstate'. We go to the higher hills several times a year. Blue Ridge Parkway is less than two hours from us. So we took this for part of the hilly drive. Between SC Hwy 11 and US Hwy 64; that route is quite narrow, up/down hill, and windy. The friction mount never slid off our glove box. I took a picture of the mount but decided not to post it here because someone already has similar one. Why waste people's time and bandwidth?In short, as much time we spent on mounting the suction mount--sometimes even spitting on it (dummy us again)--only to see it too often fall down to rattle out nerves, this is a great solution. Extra money well spent.\n",

      "After doing some research, we picked this particular model because 1) it is discontinued and so we got an awesome price and 2) I wanted the text to speech for street names and 3) we will be travelling in Europe next spring and it came bundled with both North America and Europe maps. (Even though the model is now discontinued, it came loaded with current maps - dated 2008 and 2009.)We love it.  So far its major test was landing in a large, unfamiliar airport late at night and having to find our way 30 miles to our destination in the dark in a rental car.  It was perfect.I really appreciate the \"text to speech\" feature - the exact street name is far easier to follow than just \"turn right\" when you're in a crowded area.I also like the size - the screen is easy to see, yet it's very compact - and the fact that it's really easy to pop into a pocket or purse.  We're looking forward to using it off-road walking around European cities.  The limitation there will be the battery time, but it did come with European adapters for the AC charger, so we can charge it up each night.This model came with other features I have not tried and will probably never use (MP3 and bluetooth e.g.) but the basic navigational functioning is great.\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "This is my first Navi ever, but I'm no stranger to it, I just never owned one till now. For the features I was looking for, I narrowed my options to The Garmin 2620, Garmin C330, and Megellan 700. Needless to say the C330 was my pick.I painstakingly reviewed these (3) GPS items and read every review and feedback I could find, then I comb the manufacturers websites for all specs and features,updates yaddy yadda, then I made a few trips to the store to get some hands on experience and feel of the products.The C330 has a refreshing out of box experience. It can be fired up right away to begin use. I did not need to read the manual to start using it, the idiot proof interface makes it very easy to learn, which is a plus because my wife can use it when I'm doing the driving. The models that I also considered provided a little more features than the C330, But they did not have an internal power source. Memory-wise, the C330 has a 2 GIG micro drive, which is quite adequate for all the US maps and any updates etc.Personally, my heart was set on the Magellan 700, but the cost and the fact that it only had 2 million POI (Points of Interest) compared to Garmin 5 million POI, turned me away from it. Of the (3) items I considered, the C330 is the only one that has a 100% touch screen interface and the smallest size so that it can be mounted/stored anywhere. GPSs' are not getting any bigger, with today's designers using micro/flash memory technology, our units will become more inconspicuous.The C330 can be a little difficult to see in the Sunlight, but not too bad. The Megellan 700 and the Garmin 2620 does have a port for an external antenna as well as the C330, which can be had for about $20 from a third party source.The manual is very easy to read and colorful, but I found that it was not in-depth, some things I had to call Garmin to clarify. I was curious about the internal battery, that only they can change. It would cost $125 just to send the unit in if it needed work outside of the warranty period.....hopefully the battery will last about five years when I'm ready to upgrade.Garmin updated maps usually comes out every 10-14 months so one is due out any time now. and it would cost me $75 to update the maps if I so desire. If you plan to get one and you get it on or after the new maps release date, the upgrade would be free.I'm very please with the touch screen response and the layout out the maps, the list of Hotels, restaurants etc. all w/ phone numbers too. the volume is great, as long as you're not do 80MPH w/ your windows down. It recognizes dirt roads also - provided that the roads all existed before 2004 (the last map release date).I will not be redundant and mention all the other points that the previous reviews mention, but for the most part the (3-4) reviews before mine were accurate and very helpful.The C330 does not display your elevation, which is a minus, it's nice to know when driving in the mountains.This unit has its share of nuggets to find that will just leave you in amazement. If I had to choose all over again I'll still get the C330.Buyers beware, If you purchase the more expensive model (c330) it comes preloaded with all the maps so there is no need to be transferring data back and forth, but you DO NOT get the software on City Select CD ROM. If you opt for the cheaper version (C320) you will get the City Select CD, because the entire map can't fit on that unit..you'll have to transfer data via memory card.I've also noticed that unless you are looking directly perpendicular to the screen, the colors don't show correctly, in other words if you are the driver or passenger and you look at the screen at an angle, it will be still visible but the colors tend to wash out, sort of like with a laptop if the screen is not tilted right.My experience with Tech support is fair. The wait time is a little lengthy, but once one the phone, they don't try to rush you through your questions to get you off the phone. I was helped adequately with all my questions.A great advantage is the mounting flexibility, any area of the windshield, the dashboard or console (comes w/base mount) or as a handheld providing the internal battery doesn't quit. Icons, splash screens and markers can by customerized via the Garmin software on their website. the images can be transported back and forth from the unit as BMP files and edited.There are three ways to view the map1) Bird's eye view with the map always facing north and the arrow/cursor moves as you drive.2) Bird's eye view with the arrow remains still and the map moves around as you drive3) \"3D\" mode. Where the view is the same as you would see out of your windshield except it's slightly elevated so you can see a wider angle and detect streets about a block away an all three sides of you.The unit automatically detects your speed and zooms out when you're driving fast and zooms in when you're moving slow, so you're never over/under driving the map. The receiver is very good in my opinion, sometimes (depend on what part of the house I am) I get a good signal indoors. I have my C330 mounted above my rearview mirror in my vehicle (barely got it to fit) so it does NOT have a clear view of the sky and if it did, the factory tint in the windshield would also block it...yet I get a good signal. Mounting it on the middle of my windshield yield the best results and start up time, but I chose to mount it above my rearview mirror to eliminate any sunlight glare from hitting the screen and it's working great.To respond to previous reviewers comments.... It was pointed out that Garmin should've added a feature where you can see an Icon or marker that indicated the locations of all the POI nearby as you drive by them. Well I've found a way to do it, although it's not noted in Garmin's sub-par manual. All you have to do is go to [Menu - Where To - Show Map] and you'll see all the attractions, lodging, eating, gas etc. locations on the road/area that you're currently on.Another thing that's not mentioned on the manual. Lets say you're somewhere and you don't know the address, but you want to save and revisit that location. Go to [Menu - Where TO - Show Map - Info - Save]\n",

      "These headphones sound far better than they have any right to, given their price and easy-to-drive nature.  I own Grado SR-225's and an Apogee Duet DAC/ADC unit, and when I listen to my iTunes library on my Macbook Pro with the Grados and Duet, the sound quality is clearly superior to my PX100's and iPod Touch.  To be sure.  But the Duet is a $500 DAC and the Grados are $200 headphones, not to mention the Macbook Pro!  At about $50, the PX100's are a flat-out incredible bargain, and what's more, they can easily be driven by portable music players like an iPod.  This together with how portable they are, makes these a very easy and smart choice.  Buy them.  You won't regret it!I went with these instead of IEM's like the Shures or Etymotic Research because I need to be able to hear the environment around me most of the time.  As much as I may want to, I can't isolate myself from it most of the time, and these headphones definitely let you hear both your music and the sounds around you.  Also, I don't like sticking things deep inside my ear.  I don't even like ear buds, even apart from their atrocious sound quality.  Plus, keep in mind that closed headphones are harder to design and build than open ones, although some companies manage to pull it off quite nicely.  Point is that the open nature of these headphones is in part responsible for their good sound quality.So, as mentioned by others, these headphones accentuate the bass a bit, but in a way that isn't annoying or displeasing.  Still, if you're into flat response and high accuracy neutral sound, give these a pass.  Most people won't mind the slight bass accent, however, or may even like it.  I think it goes pretty well with the overall sound balance of these headphones.  The midrange and highs are excellent, although the soundstage isn't as open and spacious as more expensive, full sized cans, like my Grado SR-225's.  I wouldn't want these to be the only headphones I owned, but I actually end up doing the majority of my listening on these, and I'm quite happy with them.Getting the knack of deploying and replacing these takes some time, but is well worth it.  Here's what works for me: open the case by holding it in your left hand (assuming you're right handed) and depressing the release with your right.  Push the cover out of the way and unwind the cord all the way.  Now pull the phones out of the case and bring your right hand around them to grip the grommet on the cord.  Hold the cord to the left of the grommet with your left hand and PUSH the grommet away with your right hand.  Now grab the grommet with your left hand while holding the cord with your right hand, and pull the grommet out all the way to the end of its travel.  Now, hold the headphones so that the pads are facing down and away from you and the cord is hanging down and away from you.  Extend the leg on your left first, then the one on your right.  Now flip the headphones around so that you can read the \"Sennheiser\" label right side up, and finally, snap each pad in place and you're all set to go.  This may sound complicated and tedious, but once you do it a few times, you can unpack and repack these in about 10 seconds or so.  No joke.  It is possible to pinch the cord in the hinges if you're not careful, so keep that in mind.The build quality of these headphones is quite good, and the case and fold-up mechanics are well designed.  If you've only ever heard the sound from the Apple ear-buds, you'll be in sonic heaven with the PX100's.  And if you're used to truly high quality sound from full size headphones or IEM's, you'll be pleasantly surprised with how good the PX100's sound.  Highly recommended.  In fact, I like these so much, and rely on them so heavily, that I am buying a second set to keep new in the package as a spare in case I break or lose my first set, and in case Sennheiser ever decides to discontinue these.  For the money, they're that good.  Incredible performance to price ratio.\n",

      "My co-worker first let me borrow a pair of his Phillips noise-canceling headphones he purchased at Costco when I went to China last year.  Wow, did they really do the job.  I had never really used noise-canceling headphones before but was amazed at the difference in sound when I wore them on the plane.  The difference was immediately noticeable when I put them on, but I didn't really appreciate how well they worked until them came off the first time I got up to go the the bathroom.  The roar of the engines was almost deafening when I took them off and so I tried to keep them on most of the rest of the flight to cut out the drone of the engines.After the trip, I was able to get my company to purchase a pair for me because we were quickly out-growing our office and were almost sitting on top of each other.  We got them so we could cut-out the talking and noise of each other and hopefully work better and increase productivity.  While they did help some and did pay for themselves, they just do better on the lower decibel level sounds, not the talking level sounds--for that noise-isolating headphones or ear buds are better.I haven't really used these much for the sound so I can't really comment on that other than they do provide much better sound quality than the average earphones or ear buds--so when I do use them for watching movies, TV or listening to music on my computer, they are nice to have.  I'm not really picky that way though so I can't really comment on how much better or worse they are than other comparable brands.The one problem I have had with them is sometimes I get a small shock on my ear.  I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but it does happen every now and then.Overall, I would recommend these.  They come in a nice hard case with adapter kit and are easy to travel with--a bit bulky, but definitely worth it.\n",

      "I previously had the Boss 5.25&#34; 3 way speakers (the cheap ones, similar to this) and can say I am much happier with the performance of the Pyle than the Boss. They are obviously no match for more expensive speakers, but they get the job done and sound nice. You can really hear the highs. I route all the bass to a separate subwoofer. Threw them in my 98 wrangler (with custom mounting brackets) and they can be heard with the top down on the highway, which is all I asked for. If I blow these ones like the Boss's I'll update my review with how loud they can go.\n",

      "I want to like these headphones.  I bought a pair of SportaPros and wanted a second pair, tried the PortaPros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews.  Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong.  No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros.  Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range.  I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the \"burn-in\" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros.  Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now.  Or my ears are getting \"burnt-in\" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to \"All I've Gotta Do\" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel.  On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc).  WTH is the deal with these?** Another update - A1 Accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though I've already lost all my original packaging and stuff.  So many thanks to them for so far great customer service.  I'll post on the new ones when they arrive.** Update 1/31/11.  Quick service from A1 Accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better.  Now I can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable (and channels are no longer switched).  I am finding that the Firm - Light settings are very touchy.  They don't want to stay on the \"Light\" setting easily but that is a minor problem.  I am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect this.\n",

      "Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer.I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here.You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS.I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it.And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to.one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding.20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard.Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds!In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better.Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on.It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" or, \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb.With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the \"BASS\" button: if the button is in the \"music\" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the \"movie\" position (I think \"music\" is a flatter frequency response).As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up:yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W;), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too.It's a absolute pleasure to listen to.Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch.If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz.Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review.\n",

      "Summary: bright earphones with good tonal quality, adequately comfortable, with great insulation.  Construction could be better.These earbud phones complement my other open, full-size cans (Sennheiser HD 580, AKG 240M).  Mostly I listen to MP3 played on my computer.  My setup is simple, just an amplified external D/A converter (M-Audio Audiophile USB) because the audio card of my laptop is ratty.  Most of the recordings are 192 kbps cbr mp3.  For the record, my ears work between 18Hz and 16kHz as tested; beyond that I'm deaf.I've owned the ER6i for quite a while (months), and I'm generally happy with them.  They come with a soft case the size of a small soap bar that is convenient for transport; a set of foam plugs; and a set of soft 3-flanged plugs.  The fit to my ear canal of the flanged plugs is very satisfactory, to the extent that at time after inserting them I have to release pressure from my ears as when changing elevation in an airplane.  I've never tried the foam plugs.  Insulation with the flanged plugs is effective to the point of being dangerous: OK in an office or in comparable circumstances, but inappropriate almost anywhere else.  Since I have no means to quantify the degree of insulation, I can only comment that it's difficult for me to hear the phone ringing on my desk when listening to music at moderate levels.The sound quality is good.  The following is a short, subjective comparison with the HD580.  Bass: precise and measured, a bit thinner than the HD580, which are not bass-heavy to start with.  Drums come out well defined and without smears.  Low range strings are just beautiful.  If you are a bass monkey, however, you may be disappointed unless you process the signal beforehand.  These earbuds can reproduce a big bass if the source requires it or the listener so prefers; but they may need encouragement in the latter case.  Midrange: sharp, pleasant, balanced.  Never too present or too far.  Almost as analytical as the HD580.  What else is to be said?  High:  a lot more generous than the HD580, but still well controlled.  When the source is good, it's a pleasure; if the source is poor it's not very forgiving.  Even if evident, however, the high range is not overpowering.  Watch out for cranky or noisy amps, like that built into my laptop: they are devastating to the ER6i.  Perhaps this is the reason I had to improve on it . . ..  Fortunately my external D/A is totally silent, no hiss at all that I can hear.My main complaint about these earphones is about their mechanical construction.  Perhaps by design the intent was to create a very light accessory; if that was the goal it has been achieved with a vengeance.  They are lightweight to the point of being borderline flimsy.  Handling with care is greatly recommended.In a sentence, very very good value.\n",

      "This is a great product and at ~$125 it's a great value.The big unexpected plus is the simi-hard zip case that comes with the headphones.  I knew it was included but didn't think much off it.  Now I see it is real value added.  These headphones are an expensive bit of equipment and unlike disposable earbuds that can be crushed in the bottom of your bag, they deserve a bit of protection.Other nice touches are the included adaptors and AAA battery.  Realistically I've already got the adaptor I'll use, but it was a thoughtful addition; the AAA battery I've got too, but is another sign of the way the Audio-Technica approached the ATH-ANC7.Noise cancellation (aka: the reason you are looking at these)...These are very nice headphones, but not, nor expected to be, audiophile headphones.  The feature-set seems geared towards the audio conscious commuter.  Regardless of the intention that's why I got them and that's how I'll review them.1. Passive noise cancellation:  These are serious headphones, put them on and the world fades into the background.  This isn't quite like wearing ear-muff style ear protection (think heavy industry), but it's a lot better than the in-canal optional iPod headphones.2. Active noise cancellation: No questions asked, it works.  The first time you flip that switch asking yourself \"does noise cancelling actually work\" you'll be pleasantly suppressed by the answer.  The first time I tested these I was in a loud data center, I flipped the switch, I was in silence.  It was just like being at home when the power goes out: suddenly all of the mechanical white-noise was gone.3. Active noise drowning: I'm not sure if this is a feature, a bug, or just a characteristic but it seems that turning on active noise cancellation amplifies the input.  I've tried testing this in a silent room to control for the drop in background noise and I really do think it is amplification of the signal.  I feel like this is a little bit of a sleazy design to trick people into thinking they are getting `better than silent' performance.  Regardless, it's not a big problem for me.Now here's the but... On a loud subway these things are amazing at dropping out all of the random stuff in the background.  If, however, two people sit down next to you and start talking you actually hear them MORE clearly than you would with the active noise reduction turned off.  Because the system takes out all the background but seems to do nothing to conversations, the conversations around you sound much louder.Bottom line / where did that last star go?For an hour our two these things are comfortable.  For much more than that I find them a bit uncomfortable, and increasingly so with time.The amplification of conversations could be a technical limitation or it could be a limitation of this particular implementation.  Either way it's a downer.Finally pricing, at $125 the price is right.  At twice that the price is not right.\n",

      "This is the question for many 2.1 speaker buyers.  Since I own both, I feel somewhat qualified to provide an answer.  Both of these speaker systems are excellent, no doubt about that, but which is superior?  Their sound is quite similar, and I like them both, but my vote has to go to the Z623s.  The bass is a bit more powerful, with midrange and highs being equal, in my opinion.  If you'd like an unbiased opinion, go here:  [...]Look, you''ll most likely be happy with either system, so don't sweat it.  Go for the best buy available.  I purchased both in early 2013.  The that time, the Klipsch were priced $10 cheaper.  Right now the Logitech is by far cheaper, and I'm considering ordering a set for my bedroom TV.  The Logiech has a 2-year warranty, if that's important to you.  The Klipsch only offers 1 year.  The Logetch provides 200 watts RMS power.  The Klipsch power rating appears to be peak power, not RMS, and is thus quite a bit less powerful.  Still, the Klipsch has great sound, and I don't think it will disappoint you.  If you're in a location where you can listen to both, do so by all means.  Your ears should be the determining factor.\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "My feelings about these headphones vary greatly depending on the mood I'm in. When I'm feeling like a very mellow, emotional, darkish sound, I turn to my Sony MDR-CD3000. When I feel like a change of pace, I turn to these to bring energy and an incredible (and this will sound corny) \"lightness of being\" to my music.These have excellent highs that are as good as I have heard. I also love the highs on my Ety ER4P as well as the slightly less emphasized highs on my Sony MDR-CD3000, each has their own charm but these are different from, rather than necessarily worse than the other two. The tradeoff here is that with poor equipment or poorly-recorded material feeding these headphones, the pretty, sparkly highs can turn a little shrill and fatiguing, and the entire sound can be pretty dry.The K701 mids are beautiful, slightly forward, sparkly, and breathtakingly transparent. They have a unique way with female voices that makes them sound clear as crystal and incredibly melodic. What they don't do as well is capture the \"authority\" of voices (maybe due to the fact that they're a little bass-light) as well as some of the warmer headphones I've heard. So, for example, someone with a clear, high, ringing voice like Eva Cassidy sounds excellent, but there's a little something missing with throatier singers like Christina Aguilera or many male vocalists.The bass is the region in which these headphones are most lacking. The bass it does have goes quite deep, has excellent texture, and is very controlled, but in comparison to most other cans (with some exceptions) the bass is just not very impactful. It's there, but you can't really feel it, and it can be overshadowed a little bit by the treble and mids.The soundstage on these cans is truly special, and the best (by a lot) I've heard on any headphone I have listened to. It's huge, airy, three-dimensional, and completely immersive. There's nothing like listening to some big orchestral music with these headphones and closing your eyes and being able to \"see\" the orchestra out in front of you. Like this headphone's other strengths, however, it comes with a caveat: the bass-light nature of the 'phones, its slight tendency towards dryness, and its huge soundstage can with certain types of music (especially thin recordings) make the music sound like it's \"falling apart\" a little bit and not fully resolving itself.The K701 captures instrumental texture/timbre better than anything I've heard, with the CD3000 a close second here. It's incredibly natural. This contributes to it sounding truly outstanding with orchestral music and a lot of jazz.Last, you won't be wanting for detail with these AKGs. They are among the best in this regard that I've heard.Some final comments:First, as mentioned above, these work very well with certain genres of music and not as well with others. If you're considering buying these headphones, you should definitely take your musical taste heavily into account. If you spend a lot of time listening to orchestral/instrumental music or a lot of acoustic stuff or jazz, these should be a serious contender. If, on the other hand, you tend more towards electronica, rock, metal, or pop, there are probably better options out there for you. This also goes for poorly-recorded material - I can't think of much else that I have listened to that is less forgiving of poor source material than these.Second, I think the fact that they are so dependent upon having powerful, high-quality amplification means that their price can be a little misleading. At their current pricing in the mid- to high-$200s, I think the headphones themselves are a real bargain, beating out (to my ears) everything less expensive than them and many headphones that I've listened to that cost a pretty penny more (including all the other mid/high-fi stuff I've heard besides my Sony, such as the HD650, DT880, Denon D5000, K601, Audio Technica W1000, Grado 325, and Sony SA5000). However, this assumes the right setup powering them. They aren't necessarily \"entry-level\" cans because they benefit so much from having some heavy-hitting equipment to really get them sounding good.For what it's worth, I highly recommend the Head-Direct EF1 with these - the strengths of this amp seem to match very nicely with these 'phones, eliminating a good deal of the dryness and adding a nice touch of warmth as well as some bass presence, and it's not that expensive.If what I've written so far about these headphones makes them sound like they're up your alley, I encourage you to take the plunge - you'll be richly rewarded with some audio magic.\n",

      "I embarked on an expensive journey of finding a good pair of listening headphones in the sub-$200 range, happily settling on the ATH-A900. For reference, my definition of a good pair of speakers or headphones is that the audio mimics what I would expect to hear from a band playing in front of me. More specifically, sounds should never seem absent if they would be strongly reproduced by a live presentation. To me, a good pair of headphones presents a good recording in a way that doesn't make you wince at the highs or get muddy in bass - no sound should be drowned out, nor underrepresented. That said, I don't consider myself to be an 'audiophile', so take my review as one from a picky audio enthusiast.For my quest, I bought theAKG K240MKII - AKG STUDIO STANDARD SEMI OPEN 55OHM HP(semi-open),Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones, and the Audio Technica ATH-A900, in that order. While I ended up selling the K240's due to a seeming inability to reproduce bass, I almost found what I was seeking in the ATH-M50. One thing the ATH-M50 reviews didn't seem to cover was that they truly are a DJ headphone -- they seem biased toward bass, somewhat flat on the treble and mid reproduction, and are really tight on large heads (really poor comfort qualities). Still a great pair of phones, but they weren't what I was looking for in a 'listening' phone.The ATH-A900 quickly became my top choice. They exceed the AKG K240MkII in every way (unless weight is a concern) and seem to be a more robust, well-rounded, and quality listening phone than the ATH-M50. To my ears, they produce sound in the way I expect (see first paragraph), but have such a great range they seem to do any genre well. My primary musical tastes are rock, folk, punk, and instrumental. To test the bass response, I even tried out some Dubstep on Pandora and found that the bass reproduction was excellent. However, I wouldn't call it a 'bass enhanced' phone, so real bass-heads might not appreciate these the way I do. I've found that their rock, americana, and folk reproduction is excellent. Another thing I really appreciated was their efficiency -- I've found that these are well suited even to use on an iPod (a source with a small amp).My strongest critique is that I really do not like how the cord is not replaceable. At this price point, I think this is an essential feature. The cloth-covered cord type is a constant tangle and the length is far longer than I need it to be. My other critique is of color -- the blue is kind of tacky. I would prefer that these come in black, or the gunmetal gray of their open sibling, theAudio Technica ATH-AD900 Audiophile Open-air Dynamic Headphones. I suppose the color issue has been fixed in theAudio-Technica Audiophile Closed-Back Dynamic Headphones-Black(ATH-A900x) at a higher price.All in all, I centered on these due to their great frequency response in the high, mid, and low ranges. They're the first pair I tried that I felt were really tuned to my listening style. They're not thumpy or bright -- to me, they're just right across the board. They are also very comfortable. I almost found what I wanted in the ATH-M50, but I feel that the ATH-A900 is the 'big brother' model that is geared more toward quality home listening, which is exactly what I was after.\n",

      "I bought this because the device I *really* wanted was one I just couldn't justify the cost of. Overall, I've been pleased with the Garmin 305, though. I primarily use it for tracking metrics on my walks, which are training toward walking half-marathons and marathons.In general, it does a very good job of this. The depiction of the walk on the Garmin software is pretty accurate. Some limitations I've found:* When I'm walking in downtown Indianapolis, which doesn't have particularly huge buildings, I have extreme difficulty acquiring a satellite if I want to track my pace. I have absolutely no difficulties away from taller buildings, however. At home, acquisition is virtually instantaneous. At work, it can take upwards of 10 minutes, and I rarely have the time to stand around looking like an idiot consulting a very bulky watch while I'm at work.* It really is pretty bulky. I don't have very large wrists, and it's pretty chunky. That said, it's not nearly as bad as I expected. So, bulky, but not way out of line.* The heart rate can be difficult to acquire. I was *very* pleased that it's a digital signal, because this is less apt to be confused by other HRMs around me (the one thing I didn't like about most Polars); however, my girlfriend simply can't get it to read her. If you're carrying significant weight around your upper abdomen, you may have trouble. Or, it might just be her. I haven't had any trouble.* Don't really pay attention to the pace most of the time. If the satellites have trouble tracking you because your under foliage or obscured by a building, it won't read you correctly. And can you really be sure that you aren't being obscured somehow? I do sort of check my average pace, but more toward developing a feel for how fast I'm going. My preference would have been for a foot-pod-driven pace tracker, but I couldn't afford the systems which use it.The difficulties are why I gave it three stars instead of four. Things I really, really like a lot:* I get a feel for where my heart rate is throughout the session. I'm generally trying to stay in Zone 2, and this helps me know when I'm there. I'm hoping to notice myself staying in Zone 2 more as I get more fit.* I can customize the screen for up to four different read-outs. I like that a lot. And there are literally dozens to choose from.* I can get a feel for what my pace is. Even though I don't pay minute attention to the pace, I do use this as an overall check.* I have room to grow with the system. No doubt I will find more ways to use this as I go along.* I already had some familiarity with Garmin because I own one of their GPS'.Bottom line is that there are definitely better items out there, but probably none that is as reasonably priced as the Forerunner 305.\n",

I absolutely love the Audeze, and find them to be extremely neutral (do we really know what neutral is, though?) with my HiFiMan EF-5 amp, with a seductive midrange.But this review is about the HD-600.  A friend lent me his extremely tweaked Bottlehead Crack AND his HD-600s, since the Crack will not drive my planars well.  My god, I really love the HD-600 on that amp!  After doing some comparisons and finding that it is very true that the Crack will not drive low-impedance cans well, I pulled out my little Schiit Magni to do more listening.  The Senns sound fabulous on that amp, too (and so do the LCD-2, and in my opinion best the Senns just by a bit).So, that's a lot of typing to give some background.  I just wanted to say that it would be highly unlikely for anyone to be disappointed by these headphones.  I found them to be really great sounding, even in the company of my Audeze cans, so I might just have to have a set, if only to be able to enjoy, say, OTL headphone amps.I think these should be on your short list if you want some accurate headphones.\n",

      "I could have given this five stars,but I just purchased this little gem a few days ago and Im just getting used to it. I love the small screen size and the incredible picture. Another plus is once you attach the battery pack there is no need to remove it unless you want it even more compact. It does act as a stand and one of the fun aspects of this unit is that you can bring it virtually anywhere(it even fits in a big pocket)and can watch a DVD.I have quite a library of TV shows on DVD, and say you are waiting forsomeone, or you have a fewminutes to kill before an appointment or whatever, you can just take this baby out and watch a 25 minute sitcom!I am looking forward to bringng this with me on a cross country train trip next month. I d like to buy another battery for this unit, but I have no idea if they sell them alone.I have always been a litte wary of Coby products. The headphones they have are awful, but I bought this and the 5 inch TV DVD radio from Coby and both so far seem great.\n",

      "I've been searching for a reasonable way to carry all of my photography equipment, a laptop, and a tripod all in one package. I had another lowepro computer/AW bag, but half the space was devoted to other storage, so as my equipment collection grew, it became unwieldy to use.The computrekker is all photography storage, with enough room left over for the necessary computer items one would need on location. In my computrekker i have:2 camera bodies (digital and medium format film)70-200 f/2.824-70 f/2.819-35 f/3.5-5.650 f/1.81.4 extenderextra battery magazine8 AA holder caseAA charger2 battery chargersMOO cardsMS-1 flash430ex2 pocketwizardsshoemount multi clamp430ex diffusertwo walkie talkiesand assorted accessories, film, cleaners, pens, and other necessities, with PLENTY of room to spare. i havent even used the secondary compartment yet.the bag makes all of this equipment that was destroying my neck in my shoulder bag effortless to carry. the bag is comfortable, adjustable, and even the tripod holder which i hated on my old bag is useful and carries the tripid WITHOUT LATERAL MOVEMENT as long as i use both of the straps on hold it in the middle and top.in fact, my only complaint about the bag is that the tripod holder is below the bottom, meaning its more difficult to sit with the backpack on while carrying a tripod. i would have preferred that the strap raises the tripod so the bottom would be level with the bottom of the bag.since my style of photography  takes me traveling frequently, the computrekker is not something i would use while walking around a downtown area. instead, i would use it to carry all the equipment that i would need to my first destination, then use a smaller bag to carry just what i needed for the day. if necessary, i could carry both without a problem since all the weight is now comfortably situated on my hips instead of my shoulders and neck.i highly recommend the computrekker AW plus, though i advise going to your local camera store first to try out what size bag and style is right for you. plan not only for the gear you have now, but what you may acquire in the future when deciding what size bag you need. also consider airline restrictions and how you will be using the bag.\n",

      "I bought an ASUS laptop from Amazon (N53SM-ES72 - nice laptop, but that's another review), and added this bag to carry it around. Note the Asus has a 15\" screen, but the border around it makes its size comparable to a 17\" laptop. Therefore, this computer fits quite snugly in this bag.The bag is very attractive and constructed sturdily. I purchased the laptop back in June, and I pack it full for my daily commute. Usually laptop straps begin to slide under the bag's weight, but to this day the strap isn't sliding from the WEIGHT of the bag, and I don't even have any nicks or scuffs on it.My biggest issue with the bag is that it cannot fit much more than my laptop, its rather large power cord, and some documents. The bag has departments and sleeves for papers, and I have a notebook in mine. It also has pockets for smaller pads, cards and pens, but you will have trouble fitting anything else in this case. If you're like me, and wish to maybe carry some gym clothes in this bag for after work, you'll be hard pressed. I can jam a paperback novel into the pouch on the side, but I've been unable to fit my lunch in it.Still it's great value for what it is - a LAPTOP case. I don't use any other laptop case - just the proctective lining of the bag, and it protects very well. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't have much more than a laptop and papers to carry around. I am well beyond college, but I couldn't imagine fitting more than one textbook in here with a laptop.UPDATE: AS OF APRIL 2013 I am still using this bag daily. The clip on the front flap has snapped partially, but keeping a rubber band around it keeps it functional. Also, the shoulder strap slides a little more now, but nothing a weekly tightening doesn't fix. I am regularly carrying my ASUS laptop in it with at least 2 books and a notebook.\n",

      "I use this with a cheap full size sunpak (22\" folded up) tripod and it works well. The strap is long enough to adjust it so that the case fits across your back. I use this for day hikes and wildlife photography. The strap is adjustable, but there isn't really any padding on the strap, so it can get a little uncomfortable on long hikes. The radius of the case is maybe 7 inches so tripods with large panning heads should fit alright. You may want to double check the specs, but I don't have to disassemble my tripod for it to fit in the bag, which I find convenient. The case its self is just a woven bag that won't really offer any protection. If you need protection you shouldn't be buying this bag, since it's not really a case at all. I think its only intended use is to store and make transporting a tripod by hand a little easier. Just man up and this tripod bag shouldn't be a problem. For the price it's a five star item.\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "I bought this item based on the reviews. It's nicely constructed but I had some issues. After trying this item for 2 weeks on a trip, I am editing my review. I'd give it 4 stars now but can't seem to edit that part of my original review.- Zipper Pulls. I'd expect the zipper pull to be a higher quality since the purpose of it is to allow you to get to your camera immediately. The zipper pull is thin with a small cord attached to it. I have a laptop backpack with a broad metal zipper pull that would've worked a lot better.EDIT: My opinion on the zipper pulls has not changed.- The Shoulder Strap. It attaches to the bag right near the zipper. So when you're accessing the camera compartment, it can get in the way... delaying the removal of your camera.EDIT: I was wearing the strap wrong. There is no obstruction at all.- Small Size. The 200 model is smaller than I anticipated. I'm 6' tall and I think the size of it looks like a backpack for girls when I'm using it. Your mileage may vary.EDIT: Yep, I still feel a bit stupid after seeing myself in the mirror with this backback. But the functionality of the backpack wins.OTHER THOUGHTS (After trying this item for 2 weeks) :- If you intend to take a plane while carrying this bag, you'd probably want to stow it by your feet or inside a carry-on luggage. There's really nowhere on the zippers to attach a mini luggage lock to keep people out. That should have been a design feature. My cheap rolling luggage has  simple metal loops to keep the zippers closed when a luggage lock is used. I used a *regulation* sized carry-on rolling luggage which also carried my Macbook (which is not a big laptop). I was barely able to close the luggage.- Backpack does not breathe well in humid environments. I wasn't expecting it to, but was hoping it would.\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "This is one of those products that looks like it got a lot of attention during the design stage. Every feature makes sense, and the best words I can use to describe the bag are \"intelligent\" and \"thoughful.\"The fit and finish are flawless, as you would expect from Lowepro. They seem to use only top-shelf fabric and hardware for their bags, and this one is no exception. The zippers are serious and smooth, and the stitching is laser-straight.Frankly, I'm kind of surprised by the other reviews that suggest this is an undersized bag. It fits my gigantic 17\" HP laptop with room to spare, and that's saying something! Even with my enormous laptop inside, there's lots of extra room for all the accessories, chargers, camera, papers, and junk I always carry around. If there's a roomier bag out there, I'd like to see it--yet this one carries like a much smaller bag. That's a sure sign of good design.I couldn't be more pleased with this bag. I spent more for the Lowepro reputation, but I feel like I'm being rewarded for that decision every day. This is a GREAT backpack!\n",

     "evalue": "\nWe use this GPS unit on our boat, and are very satisfield with its performance out on the water. We use the default maps which came with the unit.This product works well, but the default maps are not detailed and key roads are missing and are often mislabelled. Using this product to navigate roads would be awful. However, navigation by water is slightly better. Several waterways correct and are in the expected positions on the map. The features which are the most helpful are 1) the breadcrumb trail which is automatically generated and 2) the backlight, colored LCD screen which was a HUGE help to us on trips across Long Island Sound at night-- This GPS allowed us to follow our earlier-marked trail, so that even though we were out on the open ocean in complete dark we just followed our trail by GPS and navigated home safely. The backlit LCD screen also did not burn battery too quickly either. We were easily able to adjust the backlighting on the unit to give it a \"night\" mode feel. It also is clearly visible during the daytime. We use 2 recharglable AA batteries in the unit and a whole 12-hour day of being in the \"on\" mode burns about 1/2 the battery life. We feel this is an ample supply of power for day trips and would expect the same for hikers or other uses of this GPS.It's also easy to mark points of interest which is critical to finding your way back to the boat ramp in an unfamiliar place! However, it takes a few tries to get the process down. The menu isn't 100% straightfoward.The item is totally waterproof, and for novice users (like us!), it took about 20 minutes to read through the manual and get up to speed on the key features. It is easy to mark waypoints and good for displaying speeds, time, and the direction we're headed. The item also clearly displays latitude and longitude, so if we had engine problems out on the water, i'm confident we could radio in our position from the GPS and get picked up rather easily. The altitude feature on this GPS seems a little off (might be a function of the tides or wake? we've not tried it mountain climbing or anything).It also does a good job of estimating distances by water. We use it to estimate trip distances by water (can't use google maps for navigating waterways!). It is also fun to plug this GPS into your laptop at the end of the day and review your route that has been automatically saved by the GPS. This supplementary software comes with the unit.We also purchased the suction-cup holder for this unit to attach it to our windshield. Important to note that the suction cup holder occasionally drops from the windshield, so this GPS has survived a handful of falls from 3-4 feet. So we feel it's a pretty durable unit.It's as good as you'll get for the $$.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ^\nExpected end of text (at char 2749), (line:1, col:2750)",

      "\u001b[1;31mValueError\u001b[0m: \nWe use this GPS unit on our boat, and are very satisfield with its performance out on the water. We use the default maps which came with the unit.This product works well, but the default maps are not detailed and key roads are missing and are often mislabelled. Using this product to navigate roads would be awful. However, navigation by water is slightly better. Several waterways correct and are in the expected positions on the map. The features which are the most helpful are 1) the breadcrumb trail which is automatically generated and 2) the backlight, colored LCD screen which was a HUGE help to us on trips across Long Island Sound at night-- This GPS allowed us to follow our earlier-marked trail, so that even though we were out on the open ocean in complete dark we just followed our trail by GPS and navigated home safely. The backlit LCD screen also did not burn battery too quickly either. We were easily able to adjust the backlighting on the unit to give it a \"night\" mode feel. It also is clearly visible during the daytime. We use 2 recharglable AA batteries in the unit and a whole 12-hour day of being in the \"on\" mode burns about 1/2 the battery life. We feel this is an ample supply of power for day trips and would expect the same for hikers or other uses of this GPS.It's also easy to mark points of interest which is critical to finding your way back to the boat ramp in an unfamiliar place! However, it takes a few tries to get the process down. The menu isn't 100% straightfoward.The item is totally waterproof, and for novice users (like us!), it took about 20 minutes to read through the manual and get up to speed on the key features. It is easy to mark waypoints and good for displaying speeds, time, and the direction we're headed. The item also clearly displays latitude and longitude, so if we had engine problems out on the water, i'm confident we could radio in our position from the GPS and get picked up rather easily. The altitude feature on this GPS seems a little off (might be a function of the tides or wake? we've not tried it mountain climbing or anything).It also does a good job of estimating distances by water. We use it to estimate trip distances by water (can't use google maps for navigating waterways!). It is also fun to plug this GPS into your laptop at the end of the day and review your route that has been automatically saved by the GPS. This supplementary software comes with the unit.We also purchased the suction-cup holder for this unit to attach it to our windshield. Important to note that the suction cup holder occasionally drops from the windshield, so this GPS has survived a handful of falls from 3-4 feet. So we feel it's a pretty durable unit.It's as good as you'll get for the $$.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ^\nExpected end of text (at char 2749), (line:1, col:2750)"
